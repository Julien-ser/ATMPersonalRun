Lewis\u2019s acceptance lecture was a not-especially-gracious missive aimed at his critics in the United States. Yet the curmudgeonly writer managed more expansive moments, gesturing toward the historic nature of that year\u2019s award and remarking upon the state of American literature at the time, and on its status in the world.\nLewis argued that writing in the U.S. had been stunted in the years after Whitman and Twain, and mostly ignored; only architecture and film were taken seriously as popular arts among Americans. The authors who did manage to attract notice were mostly sentimental and blandly patriotic, while cultural critics, like Lewis himself, who were honest enough to express that the country had \u201cnot yet produced a civilization good enough to satisfy the deepest wants of human creatures,\u201d were disparaged. \u201cThe American novelist or poet or dramatist or sculptor or painter must work alone, in confusion, unassisted save by his own integrity,\u201d Lewis said.\nThis might have sounded familiar to an audience of European intellectuals\u2014the notion of Americans as either \u201ca puerile backwoods clan,\u201d in Lewis\u2019s phrase, or else a boorish mass of humanity enthralled by industry, science, and high finance. By recognizing Lewis with the Nobel, the committee was at once endorsing his political critiques of his home country, and also marking American literature as having come of age. Lewis noted that the award could have gone to one of his contemporaries\u2014Willa Cather or Theodore Dreiser or Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2014but he also predicted that future committees would have many talented writers to chose from among a group of young Americans that was hard at work giving the United States \u201ca literature worthy of her vastness.\u201d\nSince 1930, ten other Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Literature, including a few whom Lewis mentioned in his lecture\u2014O\u2019Neill, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway. Others, whom he couldn\u2019t have predicted\u2014John Steinbeck, Saul Bellow, Toni Morrison\u2014have become central writers in a national literary canon worthy of the vastness of this, or any other, country. Still others\u2014Isaac Bashevis Singer, Czeslaw Milosz, and Joseph Brodsky\u2014came to the United States as adults, and wrote primarily in their native languages, which reflected another step toward cosmopolitanism among American letters. (The work of the other American winner, Pearl Buck, who won the Nobel in 1938, has not aged well, and her award has become a frequently cited example of the committee\u2019s idiosyncratic choices.) Through the twentieth century, the idea of the American literary scene as an overlooked backwater faded, owing to the artistry of these writers and scores of others, but also because the United States became a haven for exiled Europeans during the Second World War and its Cold War aftermath, and, perhaps most especially, because of the economic dominance of the American publishing industry.\nNowadays, New York is the world\u2019s publishing capital for books written in English, and American literature has joined film and music as one of the country\u2019s principal artistic exports. And yet, echoes of the intellectual situation that Lewis identified in 1930 can still be heard today. Take the controversy that has attached itself to another high-profile international literary award: the Man Booker Prize. In September, the chairman of the Booker Prize Foundation announced that, beginning in 2014, his organization would no longer limit consideration to English-language submissions from the U.K., Ireland, Zimbabwe, and British Commonwealth countries, but would begin considering any novel written in English that had been published in the U.K. On its face, this seemed to be a modern, egalitarian decision. But the response, at least from some in the U.K., was to complain that the prize would be contaminated by an influx of submissions from the United States. That is a fair point: the judges will surely be seeing a lot of American novels next year, and because publishers are limited in the number of books they can submit, fewer will likely come from Commonwealth countries. It is also perfectly fair to argue, as the novelist Jim Crace has , that the Booker\u2019s specific limitations accounted for much of its meaning and relevance. (British writers have noted that they likely won\u2019t be eligible for the Pulitzer anytime soon.)\nPart of the backlash has to do with business, since one of the primary functions of a literary prize\u2014and the long and short lists that precede it\u2014is to sell books. And a more crowded international field means that books from the U.K. and the Commonwealth may have less of a chance to receive a Booker bump. There is another business argument, which connects back to what Sinclair Lewis meant when he described America, in 1930, as \u201ca land that produces eighty-story buildings, motors by the million, and wheat by the billions of bushels.\u201d It was what the English novelist Jeanette Winterson was suggesting when she told the London Evening Standard , \u201cThis country is so in thrall to America. We\u2019re such lapdogs to them, and that will skew things with the judges.\u201d Images of Tony Blair following George W. Bush around came to mind, but so, too, did Lewis\u2019s Nobel remarks about the brute force of American export capitalism. Americans would win more Bookers because they win more of everything.\nBehind the complaints about the Booker decision, there was another flavor of criticism, perhaps a kind of Old World snobbery, namely about the quality and nature of American literature itself. The British novelist Philip Hensher faults American novels for their broadness, telling the New York Times , \u201cThe big novel that speaks to all the world is not at the heart of literary achievement. Some very fine novels seem to speak much more to one culture than another and are rooted in something local.\u201d Hensher may be conflating American novels with American blockbuster films, which are often constructed to appeal to global audiences in order to maximize profits. But it\u2019s tough to imagine any novel speaking \u201cto all the world\u201d; certainly no recent American examples come to mind. Or, to put it another way, a novelist who begins with the hope of speaking to a global audience is very unlikely to produce a book that resonates with anyone. There is sometimes grumbling that American literary awards tend to value large, sprawling social-commentary novels, but a glance at the list of recent Pulitzer and National Book Award winners makes any kind of generalization seem difficult. Regardless, all good novels, whether epics or miniaturist portraits, whether American or not, are \u201clocal,\u201d to use Hensher\u2019s word; they are local to the author\u2019s consciousness, and to the particular physical and emotional landscapes it contains.\nPerhaps what offends Hensher is America itself as a setting, as if there is something not meaningfully local about American locales. In a blog post for the Guardian , he laments that the Booker had become Americanized even before it changed its official rules, since three of this year\u2019s finalists\u2014Ruth Ozeki, Jhumpa Lahiri, and NoViolet Bulawayo\u2014now live and work in the United States at least part-time. Each of their novels tells a story about other countries through what Hensher dismisses as the \u201creassuring\u201d filter of North American suburban culture. Or, as he told the Times: \u201cNovels about Indians who leave their exotic homeland and live in New Jersey are fine, but they shouldn\u2019t crowd out those who write about their own culture.\u201d (Lahiri\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Lowland,\u201d is partly set in Rhode Island.) Hensher writes as if foreign writers ought to be protected from the banality of American suburbia\u2014and world readers must be shielded from any literary output that might result from the mixing of the two. As for the future of the Booker, he writes, \u201cthe novel written by an Indian, living in India, about India, without reference to his later life in Cincinnati\u201d doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\nMany have seen the Nobel Prize in Literature, meanwhile, as a kind of international referendum on American literary hegemony. The prize hasn\u2019t been awarded to an American since 1993, when Toni Morrison won. The sniping about years of snubs might just have been chalked up to sour grapes, had it not been for the comments, in 2008, by Horace Engdahl, who was at that time the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy. \u201cThe U.S. is too isolated, too insular. They don\u2019t translate enough and don\u2019t really participate in the big dialogue of literature. That ignorance is restraining,\u201d he said. Not everything in the remark was outrageous; American publishers do translate too few books from other languages into English\u2014just three per cent of books published each year are translations. Yet his remarks overlooked the fact that more than sixty million Americans speak a primary language other than English\u2014meaning that the United States is far from being backwardly monocultural or monolingual. Philip Roth\u2019s New Jersey is also Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s New Jersey.\nCritics in this country responded angrily , to which later Engdahl expressed his surprise, and noted that he had perhaps been speaking too generally. He stepped down as permanent secretary in 2009, and his replacement, Peter Englund, has walked back his predecessor\u2019s indictment of American writing. But the damage was done, and commentators began to see the Nobel Prize in Literature as being actively denied to American writers, and on the same grounds that American intellectuals have long been dismissed by Europeans. Perhaps the best way to insult an American with aspirations to cosmopolitanism is to call him and his fellows ignorant rustics, functional only in English and kept safely away from real intellectual rigor and debate by geographical isolation, local peace, and relative material abundance. The Swedes had decided that we were, as Sinclair Lewis remarked back in 1930, still \u201ca puerile backwoods clan.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d a well-lettered American might ask, \u201cWhich is it? Are we too disengaged with the world to be taken seriously, or else too deeply engaged with it to be distinct?\u201d In 1930, Lewis told his Nobel audience that his home country was \u201ccoming out \u2026 of the stuffiness of safe, sane, and incredibly dull provincialism.\u201d He was right, but, all these years later, he might be surprised to hear European intellectuals still saying those things about its literature.\nIllustration by Maximilian Bode.","title":"Why Don\u2019t More Americans Win the Nobel Prize? - The New Yorker"},{"hasanswer":true,"id":"tc_1_2","score":"3.5699329376220703","text":"Sinclair Lewis Wins Nobel Prize \u2013 on \u2018This Date in Central Minnesota History\u2019\nSinclair Lewis Wins Nobel Prize \u2013 on \u2018This Date in Central Minnesota History\u2019\nBy Jim Maurice December 10, 2011 7:30 AM\nSinclair Lewis (Stearns History Museum)\nSAUK CENTRE \u2013 December 10th, 1930 \u2013 Sauk Centre native, Sinclair Lewis, receives the Nobel Prize for Literature\nOn this date, December 10th, in 1930, Sauk Centre native Sinclair Lewis became the first American to be awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature.\nBorn in 1885 in the village of Sauk Centre, Lewis was the third and youngest son of Edwin and Emma Lewis. Young Sinclair Lewis was not like his two older brothers who excelled in sports; Sinclair preferred reading books to playing sports. This atypical personality caused Lewis to be lonely through much of his growing-up years. At one point, a 13 year-old Lewis attempted to run away from home and become a drummer in the Spanish-American War.\nLewis' boyhood home in Sauk Centre in 1970 (Stearns History Museum)\nLewis attended Oberlin Academy and then Yale. It was at Yale that he first became truly published. Lewis wrote for the Yale Literary Magazine, turning out poetry and short stories, and later becoming editor. As Lewis continued to write, his works became better-known. Before long, magazines were buying Lewis\u2019 stories, and Jack London even bought a plot from him.\nLewis struggled with the personal side of life from the time he was a boy, and his problems continued throughout his two marriages. He first married a magazine editor in 1914. The couple had one son, and divorced in 1925. Lewis\u2019 second marriage to a newspaper columnist in 1928 resulted in another son, and lasted until 1942.\nLewis reflected back on his time growing up to find most of his inspiration for his best-known work, Main Street, which was published in 1920. Lewis had hoped to sell 25,000 copies of Main Street, but sales surpassed 150,000 copies in the first few years alone. Lewis went on to write several more books, including Babbitt in 1922 which helped win Lewis his Nobel Prize for Literature.\nAfter receiving his Nobel Prize, Lewis continued writing, and produced eleven more works. Ten of those works were published while he was still alive, the eleventh would be published after his death in 1951. Lewis died in Rome, due to advanced alcoholism, a problem that had troubled his life since the mid 1930s. Lewis\u2019 remains were buried in his hometown of Sauk Centre, where his boyhood home still stands.\nThanks to the Stearns History Museum , and their volunteer Spencer Brown, for their help with our series, \u201cThis Date in Central Minnesota History\u201d on WJON.","title":"Sinclair Lewis Wins Nobel Prize \u2013 on \u2018This Date in Central ..."},{"hasanswer":true,"id":"tc_1_3","score":"3.0876007080078125","text":"Sinclair Lewis - Nobel Prize in Literature, 1930 (20 books) (download torrent) - TPB\n\u00a0Get this torrent\n(Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client !)\nSINCLAIR LEWIS (1885-1951) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and playwright.  In 1930, he became the first American writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.\"  His works are known for their insightful and critical views of American capitalism and materialism between the wars.  He is also respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women.  H.L. Mencken wrote of him, \"[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\"  His first novel, OUR MR. WRENN (1914) is a gently satiric account of a meek New York clerk traveling in Europe.  Lewis wrote four more novels and achieved only modest success.  But MAIN STREET (1920) caused a sensation and brought him immediate fame.  The book is a withering satire on the dullness and lack of culture that exist in a \"typical\" American small town, and the narrow-mindedness and self-satisfaction of its inhabitants.  BABBITT (1922) focuses even more effectively Lewis' idea of a \"typical\" small city businessman, George F. Babbitt.  The novel describes the futile attempt of its central character to break loose from the confining life of a \"solid American citizen\" -- a middle-class, middle-aged realtor, civic booster, and club joiner.  Possibly no two works of literature did more to make Americans aware of the limitations of their national life and culture than did MAIN STREET and BABBITT.  With a sharp, satiric eye and a superb gift for mimicry, Lewis continued to examine other aspects of what he considered national inadequacy.  ARROWSMITH (1925) describes the frustrations of an idealistic young doctor in conflict with corruption, jealousy, meanness, and prejudice.  The novel won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis declined because he felt that it was not awarded for literary merit but for the best presentation of \"wholesome\" American life.  Lewis closed out the decade with DODSWORTH (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society.  He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages.  After winning the Nobel Prize in 1930, Lewis wrote eleven more novels.  The best remembered is IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE (1935), a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency.  In addition to his major novels, this torrent includes a selection of Lewis' short stories (I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF) and essays (THE MAN FROM MAIN STREET), the latter of which reproduces the text of his Nobel Prize address.

But my life, aside from   such youthful pranks as sailing on cattleships from America to   England during university vacations, trying to find work in   Panama during the building of the Canal, and serving for two   months as janitor of Upton Sinclair's abortive co-operative   colony, Helicon Hall, has been a rather humdrum chronicle of much   reading, constant writing, undistinguished travel \u00e0 la   tripper, and several years of comfortable servitude as an   editor.\nI was born in a prairie village in that most Scandinavian part of   America, Minnesota, the son of a country doctor, in 1885. Until I   went East to Yale   University I attended the ordinary public school, along with   many Madsens, Olesons, Nelsons, Hedins, Larsons. Doubtless it was   because of this that I made the hero of my second book, The   Trail of the Hawk, a Norwegian, and Gustaf Sondelius, of Arrowsmith, a Swede - and to me, Dr. Sondelius is the   favorite among all my characters.\nOf Carl Ericson of The Trail of the Hawk, I wrote -back in   1914, when I was working all day as editor for the George H.   Doran Publishing Company, and all evening trying to write novels   - as follows:\n\u00abHis carpenter father had come from Norway, by way of   steerage and a farm in Wisconsin, changing his name (to   Americanize it) from Ericsen... Carl was second-generation   Norwegian; American-born, American in speech, American in   appearance, save for his flaxen hair and china-blue eyes... When   he was born the \u2039typical Americans\u203a of earlier stocks   had moved to city palaces or were marooned on run-down farms. It   was Carl Ericson, not a Trowbridge or a Stuyvesant or a Lee or a   Grant, who was the \u2039typical American\u203a of his period.   It was for him to carry on the American destiny of extending the   Western horizon; his to restore the wintry Pilgrim virtues and   the exuberant October, partridge-drumming days of Daniel Boone;   then to add, in his own or another generation, new American   aspirations for beauty.\u00bb\nMy university days at Yale were undistinguished save for   contributions to the Yale Literary Magazine. It may be   interesting to say that these contributions were most of them   reeking with a banal romanticism; that an author who was later to   try to present ordinary pavements trod by real boots should   through university days have written nearly always of Guinevere   and Lancelot - of weary bitterns among sad Irish reeds - of   story-book castles with troubadours vastly indulging in wine, a   commodity of which the author was singularly ignorant. What the   moral is, I do not know. Whether imaginary castles at nineteen   lead always to the sidewalks of Main Street at thirty-five, and   whether the process might be reversed, and whether either of them   is desirable, I leave to psychologists.\nI drifted for two years after college as a journalist, as a   newspaper reporter in Iowa and in San Francisco, as - incredibly   - a junior editor on a magazine for teachers of the deaf, in   Washington, D.C. The magazine was supported by Alexander Graham   Bell, inventor of the telephone. What I did not know about   teaching the deaf would have included the entire subject, but   that did not vastly matter, as my position was so insignificant   that it included typing hundreds of letters every week begging   for funds for the magazine and, on days when the Negro janitress   did not appear, sweeping out the office.\nDoubtless this shows the advantages of a university education,   and it was further shown when at the age of twenty-five I managed   to get a position in a New York publishing house at all of   fifteen dollars a week. This was my authentic value on the labor   market, and I have always uncomfortably suspected that it would   never have been much higher had I not, accidentally, possessed   the gift of writing books which so acutely annoyed American   smugness that some thousands of my fellow citizens felt they must   read these scandalous documents, whether they liked them or   not.\nFrom that New York position till the time five years later when I   was selling enough short stories to the magazines to be able to   live by free-lancing, I had a series of typical white-collar,   unromantic, office literary jobs with two publishing houses, a   magazine (Adventure), and a newspaper syndicate, reading   manuscripts, writing book advertising, writing catalogues,   writing uninspired book reviews - all the carpentry and plumbing   of the city of letters. Nor did my first five novels rouse the   slightest whispers: Our Mr. Wrenn, The Trail of the   Hawk, The Job, The Innocents, and Free   Air they were called, published between 1914 and 1919, and   all of them dead before the ink was dry. I lacked sense enough to   see that, after five failures, I was foolish to continue   writing.\nMain Street, published late in 1920, was my first novel to   rouse the embattled peasantry and, as I have already hinted, it   had really a success of scandal. One of the most treasured   American myths had been that all American villages were   peculiarly noble and happy, and here an American attacked that   myth. Scandalous. Some hundreds of thousands read the book with   the same masochistic pleasure that one has in sucking an aching   tooth.\nSince Main Street, the novels have been Babbitt (1922); Arrowsmith (1925); Mantrap (1926); Elmer   Gantry (1927); The Man Who Knew Coolidge (1928); and Dodsworth (1929). The next novel, yet unnamed, will   concern idealism in America through three generations, from 1818   till 1930-an idealism which the outlanders who call Americans \u00abdollar-chasers\u00bb do not understand. It will presumably   be published in the autumn of 1932, and the author's chief   difficulty in composing it is that, after having received the   Nobel Prize, he longs to write better than he can.\nI was married, in England, in 1928, to Dorothy Thompson, an   American who had been the Central European correspondent and chef de bureau of the New York Evening Post. My first   marriage, to Grace Hegger, in New York, in 1914, had been   dissolved.\nDuring these years of novelwriting since 1915, I have lived a   quite unromantic and unstirring life. I have travelled much; on   the surface it would seem that one who during these fifteen years   had been in forty states of the United States, in Canada, Mexico,   England, Scotland, France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Austria,   Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, the West   Indies, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Poland, and Russia must have   been adventurous. That, however, would be a typical error of   biography. The fact is that my foreign travelling has been a   quite uninspired recreation, a flight from reality. My real   travelling has been sitting in Pullman smoking cars, in a   Minnesota village, on a Vermont farm, in a hotel in Kansas City   or Savannah, listening to the normal daily drone of what are to   me the most fascinating and exotic people in the world - the   Average Citizens of the United States, with their friendliness to   strangers and their rough teasing, their passion for material   advancement and their shy idealism, their interest in all the   world and their boastful provincialism - the intricate   complexities which an American novelist is privileged to   portray.\nAnd nowadays, at forty-six, with my first authentic home - a farm   in the pastoral state of Vermont - and a baby born in June 1930,   I am settled down to what I hope to be the beginning of a   novelist's career. I hope the awkward apprenticeship with all its   errors is nearly done.\n\u00a0\nBiographical note on Sinclair   Lewis\nSinclair Lewis (1885-1951) continued to be   a prolific writer, but none of his later writings equalled the   success or stature of his chiefworks of the twenties. After his   divorce from his second wife in 1942, Sinclair Lewis lived   chiefly in Europe. His later novels include Ann Vickers (I933), It Can't Happen Here (1935), The Prodigal   Parents (1938), Gideon Planish (1943), Cass   Timberlane (1945), Kingsblood Royal ( 1947), The   God-Seeker (1949), and World So Wide (1951).

In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that \"in America most of us \u2014 not readers alone, but even writers \u2014 are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,\" and that America is \"the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.\" He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: \"Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.\"\nSource: Wikipedia Added by: Colin Harris\nIn 1925 Lewis divorced from his first wife and married three years later Dorothy Thompson, a newspaper correspondent, with whom he traveled to London, Berlin, Vienna, and Moscow. At that time Lewis was drinking heavily, and managed to offend most of his friends. Theodore Dreiser, the other American finalist for the Nobel Prize, was bitterly disappointed, when Lewis won the award.

The voice was that of a Swedish newspaper correspondent in New York who had managed to track down Lewis for the Swedish Embassy, but Lewis thought that it was the voice of his friend Ferd Reyher, who liked to do imitations and play jokes. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t say! Listen, Ferd, I can say that better than you. Your Swedish accent\u2019s no good. I\u2019ll repeat it to you.\u201d And he repeated it, \u201cYou haf de Nobel Brize,\u201d and more.

In 1930, he became the first American writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.\"\nHis works are known for their insightful and critical views of American capitalism and materialism between the wars. He is also respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women. H.L. Mencken wrote of him, \"[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\"\nHis first novel, OUR MR. WRENN (1914) is a gently satiric account of a meek New York clerk traveling in Europe. Lewis wrote four more novels and achieved only modest success. But MAIN STREET (1920) caused a sensation and brought him immediate fame. The book is a withering satire on the dullness and lack of culture that exist in a \"typical\" American small town, and the narrow-mindedness and self-satisfaction of its inhabitants.\nBABBITT (1922) focuses even more effectively Lewis' idea of a \"typical\" small city businessman, George F. Babbitt. The novel describes the futile attempt of its central character to break loose from the confining life of a \"solid American citizen\" -- a middle-class, middle-aged realtor, civic booster, and club joiner. Possibly no two works of literature did more to make Americans aware of the limitations of their national life and culture than did MAIN STREET and BABBITT.\nWith a sharp, satiric eye and a superb gift for mimicry, Lewis continued to examine other aspects of what he considered national inadequacy. ARROWSMITH (1925) describes the frustrations of an idealistic young doctor in conflict with corruption, jealousy, meanness, and prejudice. The novel won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis declined because he felt that it was not awarded for literary merit but for the best presentation of \"wholesome\" American life.\nLewis closed out the decade with DODSWORTH (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. After winning the Nobel Prize in 1930, Lewis wrote eleven more novels. The best remembered is IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE (1935), a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency.\nIn addition to his major novels, this torrent includes a selection of Lewis' short stories (I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF) and essays (THE MAN FROM MAIN STREET), the latter of which reproduces the text of his Nobel Prize address.\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\n* ARROWSMITH (HarperPerennial, 2012) -- ePUB\n* BABBITT (Bantam Classics, 1998).

These charts became less  irregular until the weekly \"Hot 100\" was started in 1958 .  The current chart combines sales, airplay  and downloads.\nA music collector that calls himself Bullfrog has been  consolidating the complete chart from 1894 to the present day.   he has published this information in a comprehenive spreadsheet  (which can be obtained at bullfrogspond.com\/\n).\nThe Bullfrog data assigns each song a unique identifier, something like \"1968_076\" (which just happens to be the Bee Gees song \"I've Gotta Get A Message To You\").  This \"Whitburn Number\" is provided to match with the books of Joel Whitburn and consists of the year and a  ranking within the year.  A song that first entered the charts in December and has a long run is  listed the following year.  This numbering scheme means that songs which are still in the  charts cannot be assigned a final id, because their ranking might change.  So the definitive  listing for a year cannot be final until about April.  In our listing we only  use songs with finalised IDs, this means that every year we have to wait until  last year's entries are finalised before using them.\n(Source bullfrogspond.com\/ , the original version used here was 20090808 with extra data from:\nthe 2009 data from 20091219\nthe 2010 data from 20110305\nthe 2011 data from 20120929\nthe 2012 data from 20130330\nthe 2013 data from 20150328\nThe 20150328 data was the last one produced before the Billboard company forced the data to be withdrawn. As far as we know there are no more recent data sets available.  This pattern of obtaining the  data for a particular year in the middle of the following one comes from the way that the  Bullfrog project generates the identifier for a song (what they call the \"Prefix\" in  the spreadsheet). Recent entries are identified with keys like \"2015-008\" while older ones have keys  like \"2013_177\".  In the second case the underscore is significant, it indicates that  this was the 177th biggest song released in 2013.  Now, of course, during the year no one knows  where a particular  song will rank, so the underscore names can't be assigned until every song from a particular  year has dropped out of the charts, so recent records are temporarily assigned a name with a  dash.  In about May of the following year the rankings are calculated and the final identifiers  are assigned.  That is why we at the Turret can only grab this data retrospectively.\nAttributes\nThe original spreadsheet has a number of attributes, we have limited  our attention to just a few of them:\n134\n9\nThe songs with the most entries on the chart were White Christmas (with  33 versions and a total of 110 weeks) and Stardust (with 19 and a total of 106  weeks).\nposition\nThe peak position that songs reached in the charts should show an smooth curve  from number one down to the lowest position.  This chart has more songs in the  lower peak positions than one would expect.  Before 1991 the profile  of peak positions was exactly as you would expect, that year Billboard introduced  the concept of \"Recurrent\" tracks, that is they removed any track from the  chart which had spent more than twenty weeks in the chart and had fallen to the lower  positions.\nweeks\nThe effect of the \"Recurrent\" process, by which tracks are removed if they have  spent at least twenty weeks in the chart and have fallen to the lower reaches, can clearly be seen  in the strange spike in this attribute.  This \"adjustment\" was intended to promote  newer songs and ensure the chart does not become \"stale\".  In  fact since it was introduced in 1991 the length of long chart runs has increased,  this might reflect the more conscious efforts of record companies to \"game\" the  charts by controlling release times and promotions, or it could be that the decline in  chart turnover reflects a reduced public interest in the singles charts.\nWhen we plot the average length of a song's run for songs over the period  covered it is clear that the chart has changed in the last 100 years.   Except for a short period in the late 1960s and early 1970s the average length of chart run increased steadily from  the 1920s to the 1990s .\nThis contrasts with other charts, such as the UK one where the recent trend has been for runs to get shorter.  We have no good  idea why this is.\nyearpos & bfid\nA formula is applied to each entry to assign it a ranking within the year it was  released.  This allows followers of the Billboard chart to use a combination of the  year and position to uniquely identify every entry.  This formula takes into account the  total success of the song, so it cannot be finally calculated until every song released  in a given year has completed it's chart run (which might be well into the following  year of course).  As a result the final IDs for a particular year cannot be assigned until  the end of the following year.

They published their first music \"hit parade\" in 1936 and their first \"Hot 100\" in 1958.  We understand  that from 1936 to 1958 the charts were irregular and didn't have a consistent  form.  In addition the focus was on \"sheet music\" sales so while the chart  will say, for example, that the song \"Sentimental Journey\" was a hit in  1945 it won't tell you if the version by the Merry Macs, Hal McIntyre or  Les Brown & Doris Day was the most popular.\nA US music historian called Joel Whitburn has used the information from  the irregular charts, the Billboard magazine contents and other sources to  retrospectively calculate the charts from 1890 to 1958.

It was at first little more than a gimmick, a  tool in the circulation war against NME's much older (and more popular) rival Melody Maker. The chart, at first a top 12, was the creation of the paper's  advertising manager, Percy Dickins, who compiled it by telephoning around 20  major record stores and aggregating their sales reports. He would continue to  personally oversee the compilation of the chart well into the 1960s.\nThe  chart rapidly became one of the paper's most popular features. After only a few  weeks, it started being quoted in record company advertisements and press  releases. The chart also spawned imitators - Record Mirror launched its  own chart in 1955 and Melody Maker in 1958.\nThe  forerunner of today's official chart first appeared in the music trade  publication Record Retailer (now Music Week) in 1960 as a Top 50,  but was not immediately recognised as the definitive chart in the country.  Arguably, the NME chart was still the most recognised chart, and had the  advantage of widespread exposure due to its use by Radio Luxembourg. Throughout  the sixties, the various different charts vied for public recognition, leading  to some historical anomalies \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for example, The Beatles' second single \"Please  Please Me\" was a number one on most charts, but not in Record Retailer.  To add to the confusion, the chart used by the BBC on their popular shows Pick of the Pops and Top Of The Pops was actually calculated by  averaging out all the others, and so didn't agree with any of them, and was  prone to tied positions.\nIt  wasn't until 1969 that a truly reliable, official chart emerged, from an  alliance between the BBC and Record Retailer. For the first time a professional  polling organisation, BMRB, was commissioned to oversee the chart, and a pool of  500 record shops was used - more than twice as many as had been used for any  previous chart. The new Official Top 50 was inaugurated in the week ending 12  February 1969.\nIn  1978, the singles chart was extended from a Top 50 to a Top 75.\nIn  1982, BMRB lost their contract to Gallup, who arranged for electronic data  gathering to replace the old sales diary method of compilation. The first chart  terminals appeared in record shops in 1984. As a result, in October 1987, it was  now possible for the chart, incorporating sales up to close of business on  Saturday, to be announced on Sunday afternoon, rather than being delayed until  Tuesday as was previously the case.\nIn  1990, the chart came under the auspices of CIN (Chart Information Network), a  syndicate including the BBC, Spotlight (publishers of Music Week), the  BPI and BARD (British Association of Record Distributors). This was basically a  formalisation of the previously-existing informal arrangement, and did not  significantly affect compilation.\n\u00a0\nUSA\nThe  earliest charts probably came in late 1929.\nIn the  30's there were Downbeat and Metronome Charts and maybe there were others. The  Billboard Charts started in 1940, Cashbox in 1944.\n\u00a0\nThe Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs or albums in the United States. The results are published in Billboard magazine. The two primary charts - the Hot 100 (top 100 singles) and the Top 200 (top 200 albums) factor in airplay, as well as music sales in all relevant formats. Billboard is considered the foremost worldwide authority worldwide in music charts, and the rankings have gained a following among the general public.\nOn January 4, 1936, Billboard magazine published its first music hitparade. The first Music Popularity Chart was calculated in July, 1940. A variety of song charts followed, which were eventually consolidated into the Hot 100 by mid-1958.\n\u00a0\nMethodology of its charts\nCurrently, Billboard utilizes a    system called Nielsen SoundScan to track sales of singles, albums,    videos and DVDs. Essentially, it's a system that registers sales when    products are purchased from SoundScan-enabled stores. Billboard    also uses a system called Broadcast Data Systems, or BDS, which they own    as a subsidiary, to track radio airplay. Each song has an \"acoustic    fingerprint\" which, when played on a radio station that is contracted to    use BDS, is detected. These detections are added up every week among all    radio stations to determine airplay points. Arbitron statistics are also factored in to give \"weight\" to airplay    based on audience size and time-of-day.\nAll of Billboard's charts use this    basic formula. What separates the charts is which stations and stores    are used \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd each musical genre having a core audience or retail group.    Each genre's department at Billboard is headed up by a chart    manager, who makes these determinations.\nFor many years, a song had to be    commercially available as a single to be considered for any of   Billboard's charts. At the time, instead of using SoundScan or BDS,    Billboard obtained its data from manual reports filled out by radio    stations and stores. According to the 50th Anniversary issue of   Billboard, prior to the official implementation of Nielsen SoundScan    tracking in November 1991, many radio stations and retail stores removed    songs from their manual reports after the associated record labels    stopped promoting a particular single. Thus songs fell quickly after    peaking and had shorter chart lives. In 1990, the country singles chart    was the first chart to use SoundScan and BDS. They were followed by the    Hot 100 and the   R&B chart in 1991. Today, all of Billboard's charts use this    technology.\nBefore September 1995, singles were    allowed to chart in the week they first went on sale based on airplay    points alone. The policy was changed in September 1995 to only allow a    single to debut after a full week of sales on combined sales and airplay    points. This allowed several tracks to debut at number one.\nIn December 1998, the policy was further    modified to allow tracks to chart on the basis of airplay alone without    a commercial release. This change was made to reflect the changing    realities of the music business. Previous to this, several substantial    radio and MTV hits had not appeared on the Billboard chart at    all, because many   major labels chose not to release them as standalone singles, hoping    their unavailability would spur greater album sales. Not offering a    popular song to the public as a single was unheard of before the 1970s.    The genres that suffered most at the time were those that increasingly    impacted   pop culture, including new genres such as trip    hop and    grunge.\nStarting in 2005, Billboard changed    its methodology to allow paid   digital downloads from digital music stores such as   iTunes to chart with or without the help of radio airplay.\n\u00a0\nA variety of charts\nOriginally, Billboard had separate    charts for different measures of popularity, including disk jockey    playings,   juke box song selection, and best selling records in retail stores.    There was also a composite standing chart compiled by combining those,    which gradually grew to become a top 100, the ancestor of the current    Hot 100 chart. The juke box chart ceased publication after the June 17,    1957 issue, the disk jockey chart, after the July 28, 1958 issue, and    the best seller chart, after the October 13, 1958 issue. The July 28,    1958 issue was also the last issue in which the composite chart was    called the Top 100; the following week was the start of the Hot 100    titles.\nCurrently, Billboard publishes many    different charts, with the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 being the most    famous. In 2009 Billboard partnered with   MetroLyrics to offer top 10 lyrics for each of the charts.\n\u00a0\nAt year's end\nAt the end of each year, Billboard    tallies the results of all of its charts, and the results are published    in a year-end issue and heard on year-end editions of its   American Top 40 and    American Country Countdown radio broadcasts, in addition to    being announced in the press. Between 1991 and 2006, the top    single\/album\/artist(s) in each of those charts was\/were awarded in the    form of the annual   Billboard Music Awards, which were annually held in December until    the awards went dormant in 2007 (plans for a new version of the awards    in 2008 fell through, and no awards have been held since 2007).

The Angolan peace process\nPublication date:\u00a0\nDavid Birmingham\nWhen Angola achieved independence in 1975, a war was raging between competing national liberation movements and their foreign backers. Guus Meijer and David Birmingham revisit Angola\u2019s colonial period and the independence struggle that followed and ask how the resulting social and economic divisions shaped and were manipulated by the warring parties. The article describes the introduction of authoritarian one-party rule under the MPLA and the impact of natural resource development and international and regional powers on the conflict. Tracing the conflict up to the signing of the Luena Memorandum, the authors conclude that Angola\u2019s peace remains incomplete and that the country faces many challenges in achieving social and democratic reconstruction.\nRead full article\nAngola from past to present\nOn 11 November 1975, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) declared Angola's independence and installed Agostinho Neto as its first President in the former Portuguese colony's capital at Luanda. This outcome had long seemed uncertain and indeed even unlikely; the MPLA had not only had to deal with its own serious internal troubles and disaffections, but had also had to take on the Portuguese colonial army and the two rival armed movements, each backed by powerful allies. Holden Roberto's National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) had initially been the most powerful of the three competing national liberation movements and in the autumn of 1975 it came close to capturing Luanda from the north, backed by a heavily armed force supplied by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the south, two armoured columns of a South African invasion force, acting in military coordination with the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi, almost reached Luanda before they were stopped by Cuban troops which had been rushed to the assistance of the MPLA. The independent Angolan state was thus born out of turmoil and violence and amid serious national, regional and global rivalries. This heritage with its deep historical roots was to influence the unfolding of events for a long time.\nAngola, like most African countries, grew out of a conglomerate of peoples and groups each with its own distinct history and traditions. Gradually small local nations and states came into contact with each other and historical developments drove them to share a common destiny under increasing Portuguese influence. Long before the arrival of the Portuguese, Bantu-speaking communities had established a farming economy over most of the territory. They had absorbed many of the scattered Khoisan-speaking populations and developed a successful pastoral dimension to their agriculture as well as building up trading economies. One of the most successfully diverse market centres became the town of M'banza Kongo around which the Kongo kingdom evolved. Further east the concept of state formation related to the political ideology of the Lunda peoples while in the south later kingdoms took shape in the highlands of the Ovimbundu people.\nAngola under Portuguese rule\nAlthough the first Portuguese traders, explorers and soldiers set foot on this part of the African coast from 1483, modern colonisation of the whole territory was only formalised four centuries later after the Berlin Conference of 1884-85. Wide stretches of Angola experienced colonial rule for less than a century, and even after 1900 armed revolts broke out and resistance movements sprang up as among the Ovimbundu and the Bakongo from 1913, until the last northern resistance was put down in 1917. During its century of overrule the colonial regime left crucial marks on Angolan society. Its discriminatory legislation, particularly the Statute of the Portuguese Natives of the Provinces of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea, separated the indigenous population from a tiny elite of 'civilised' individuals (or assimilados) who enjoyed some of the rights of Portuguese citizens. In 1961, after the start of an armed liberation struggle, the statute was revoked but the changes were only cosmetic. The Portuguese policy of racial and cultural discrimination had a profound and lasting impact on the later social and political development of Angola as an independent country. Social divisions created by colonialism continued to exercise a strong influence on the relationships between groups and on the attitudes of individuals. Racial mistrust manifested itself in the conflicts between as well as the tensions within the liberation movements. Deeply entrenched suspicion played a decisive role in Angola's recent political history. The conflicting interests of rural dwellers and people living in urban centres are in part another source of tension which independent Angola inherited from the colonial state.\nPortugal, like the other colonial powers, was primarily interested in extracting riches from its colonies, through taxation, forced labour and the compulsory cultivation of marketable crops such as cotton. Under the guise of a 'civilising mission', the colonial state was heavily influenced by its own distinctive variety of Catholic fundamentalism, invented by the semi-fascist dictator Ant\u00f3nio Salazar. An ideology developed under the banner of luso-tropicalism, a supposedly specific Portuguese way of harmonising Portuguese manners with the customs of peoples in the tropics. In Angola economic extraction was later supplemented by migrant influences when Portugal needed to dispose of excess population. In the 1950s and 1960s Angola received many thousands of poor white peasants and entrepreneurial settlers from Portugal. They created a colony of European descent which, although smaller than the Portuguese communities in France or Brazil, was larger than the rival colonial one in Mozambique.\nDuring the colonial period, and particularly under the corporatist 'New State' and its colonial charters perfected by Salazar when he graduated from finance minister to Prime Minister in 1932, Angola's political and economic developments were crucially linked to the motherland. In 1969 Marcelo Caetano succeeded Salazar as Prime Minister and continued to insulate Portugal's colonies, and especially the crown jewel that was Angola, from the winds of change that blew concepts of independence over Africa in the 1960s. Instead of preparing for independence, as the other colonial powers had reluctantly done after the Second World War, Portugal tried to strengthen its imperial grip. As a weak state, politically isolated and economically backward, Portugal resorted to special measures to hold on to its colonies and in 1954 it euphemistically renamed them 'overseas provinces' in an attempt to avoid the attentions of United Nations inspectors. Economically, both Portugal and Angola were always at the mercy of trends and developments in the wider global economy, determined by powers beyond their control. It had been the world economic crisis of the 1930s which had led to the impoverishment of Portugal and to the crystallisation of Salazar's authoritarian regime. In the 1950s, when Portugal aspired to become a member of the United Nations and yet keep its colonies, it was agricultural crises and opportunities that caused impending upheavals. The relative poverty of the southern highlands and the boom in coffee prices in the north drove thousands of Ovimbundu peasants to become migrant workers on the coffee estates. There they were subjected to humiliation by white colonists and to resentment by the Bakongo who lived there.\nContinuous rivalries between various elites have played an important role in Angola's recent history. The FNLA embodied the aspirations of the northern elite focused on Kinshasa but with some cultural links with the old Kongo kingdom. The MPLA had its heartland in the territory of the Mbundu people of the Luanda hinterland but included many groups in the urban centres including some who descended from the old assimilated families of black Angolans and others who were the mixed-race children of modern colonisation. UNITA became the expression of a third political tradition and embodied the economic aspirations of the Ovimbundu and their merchant leaders on the southern planalto. To a large extent the ethnic identification of these movements has come about as a result of conscious political manoeuvring by each leadership rather than as a genuine expression of popular sentiment and aspiration. Over time the social and political factors of identity and cohesion have become real.\nAngola's historical society can be characterised by a tiny semi-urbanised elite of Portuguese-speaking 'creole' families \u2013 many black, some of mixed race, some Catholic and others Protestant, some old-established and others cosmopolitan \u2013 who are distinguished from the broad population of black African peasants and farm workers. Until the nineteenth century the great creole merchants and the rural princes dealt in captive slaves, most of whom were exported to Brazil or to the African islands. The black aristocracy and the creole bourgeoisie thrived on the profits of overseas trade and lived in style, consuming large quantities of imported alcoholic beverages and wearing fashionable European costumes. In the early twentieth century, however, their social and economic position was eroded by an influx of petty merchants and bureaucrats from Portugal, who wished to grasp the commercial and employment opportunities created by a new colonial order.\nAlthough effective occupation only had a relatively short duration and elements of pre-colonial continuity persisted, colonialism nevertheless brought major social changes in urbanisation, in formal education, in religious practice, in farming techniques and in commercial linkages. These changes affected all sections of society and all parts of the country, albeit to an uneven and variable degree. There is a tendency noted above to view Angolan society, and indeed other African societies, as fundamentally split between a 'modern' sector, influenced by 'Western' (or European) values, and a 'traditional' one governed by pre-modern systems of unchanging norms and historic ritual practices. Such views, expressed in political and public discourse, tend to over-simplify the socio-cultural base of both the MPLA and UNITA when in fact each had to manage its relations with appropriate 'traditional authorities'. Angola presents a rich variety of influences and mixtures all deeply marked by the colonial experience as well as by the so-called Afro-Stalinism of the post-independence years. 'Traditional' concepts are now being transformed to adapt to the challenges of life in the present and the future. There is no part of Angola, however remote, and no sector of Angolan society, however 'traditional', which is not in some way linked to the 'modern' world of a globalised economy and its culture and communication systems.\nThe struggle for national liberation\nWhile colonial rule never went unresisted, a more focused armed struggle for independence only started in 1961, after the Portuguese had bloodily repressed a mass protest against colonial conditions in the north. Hundreds of white planters and traders (estimates vary between 250 and 1,000) and thousands of black farm workers were killed, and many more fled the country, forming a fertile recruiting ground for an emerging anti-colonial cause.\nnationalist political activity and resistance occurred initially under the banner of the Union of the Peoples of Angola (UPA), a predecessor of the FNLA. In Luanda and the coastal cities much older associations had long expressed the nationalist sentiment of Angola's African population. This urban-based nationalism also incorporated assimilados and mesti\u00e7os of Luanda and Benguela who had organised the Angolan League in the 1910s and the Let's Discover Angola (Vamos Descobrir Angola) movement in the 1940s under leaders such as Viriato da Cruz who later became founders of the MPLA.\nThe 1960s saw a major military and political confrontation between the Portuguese colonial regime and Angolan nationalism. The country also experienced the early manifestation of divisions within the nationalist movement that were to mark political life in Angola for many years. The protagonists were the FNLA, the MPLA, which subsequently tried to claim responsibility for an attack on a Luanda prison on 4 February 1961, and UNITA which emerged in the mid 1960s. The date of the prison attack was later officially celebrated as the beginning of the armed struggle.\nThe anti-colonial struggle launched in 1961 was fought with guerrilla tactics, gradually increasing in scope to reach from the north to the east of the country. On the diplomatic front nationalists worked from bases in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), Conakry and Brazzaville, as well as from Lisbon and Paris. The FNLA received political and military backing from African countries and from China and the US. In 1962 it formed a Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE) which the organisation of African Unity (OAU) initially recognised as the legitimate successor to colonial rule. Some African countries later transferred their allegiance to the MPLA which, though its military record was poor and its leadership continuously suffered from internal conflict, gradually outmanoeuvred its rivals politically and diplomatically to gain pre-eminence in 1975.\nThe FNLA was no freer from internal dissent than the MPLA and in 1964 Jonas Savimbi left the 'government in exile' in which he had served as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He accused the FNLA leaders of being militarily ineffective and heavily dependent on the US. He also denounced nepotism and the authoritarian leadership of Holden Roberto. After visiting a number of mainly communist countries Savimbi founded UNITA in 1966. By exploiting the feelings of exclusion in Angola's largest ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, Savimbi built up his own constituency in the centre and south of the country. Initially he conducted small guerrilla operations inside Angola before establishing a network of supporters abroad.\nNone of the armed movements succeeded in effectively threatening the colonial state in Angola. The end of this 'first Angolan war' was brought about indirectly through domestic pressure in Portugal and the growing dissatisfaction of the Portuguese military fighting the colonial wars in Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. In April 1974, junior officers belonging to the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA) toppled the Salazar-Caetano regime in Portugal and began the process of decolonisation. In 1974, however, a frenzy of diplomatic and political activity at home and abroad mitigated against a negotiated independence. In 1975, as the will to retain imperial control over Angola dwindled, fighting broke out in many provinces of Angola and also in the capital, Luanda, where the armies of the MPLA, the FNLA and UNITA were intended to maintain the peace with joint patrols. In January 1975, under heavy international pressure, the colonial power and the three movements had signed an agreement in Alvor, Portugal, providing for a transitional government, a constitution, elections and independence. This Alvor Accord soon collapsed, however, and the transitional government scarcely functioned. In the subsequent confrontations the FNLA received military support from Zaire with the backing of China and the US, while under Agostinho Neto the MPLA gained ground in particular in Luanda with support from the Soviet Union and from Cuban troops. On 11 November 1975 Angola became independent. The FNLA and UNITA were excluded from the city and from government and a socialist one-party regime was established which eventually gained international recognition, though not from the United States.\nAngola under one-party rule\nFrom 1975 until the late 1980s Angolan society was moulded along 'classical' Marxist-Leninist lines. A dominant, but increasingly corrupt state sector was controlled by the ruling party. Private business, with the exception of the activities of foreign oil companies, was restricted and organised religion, including the Catholic Church, which had held an official place under the colonial regime, was suppressed. No freely organised 'civil society' emerged and the state controlled the media and mass organisations for youth, for women, for workers and for some of the professions.\nOne event had a crucial impact on the political climate during Angola's socialist era: the failed coup attempt by Nito Alves and his followers on 27 May 1977. Alves was a minister in President Agostinho Neto's government but also had his own constituency of supporters in Luanda's musseques (slums). The nitista crisis was fuelled by personal ambitions but also by ideological battles within the ruling socialist camp. Some leaders were loyal to the 'bureaucratic' line practised in the USSR while others preferred a more 'revolutionary' Chinese approach. The coup itself was bloodily repressed and it is alleged that thousands of supposed sympathisers were jailed or killed in the following days, weeks and months. The episode had a profound effect on the President, and his regime became ever more authoritarian and repressive. Angola's population lost its innocence and henceforth lived in fear.\nSubsequent wars\nBy the end of the 1970s, UNITA took over from the FNLA as the main civil war opponent of the MPLA government. A rapprochement had been achieved between the MPLA and President Mobutu of Zaire. The FNLA's cadres, led by Mobutu's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Holden Roberto, were gradually integrated into Angolan society as the free-market acolytes of the one-party state. The FNLA army, once a foreign-armed force with thousands of recruits, disintegrated without being formally disarmed or demobilised.\nAgostinho Neto died of cancer in 1979 and was succeeded as President by Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, a young petroleum engineer trained in the Soviet Union. By this time the superpower conflict in Vietnam had ended and Angola became the seat of a new war by proxy between the United States and the Soviet Union. Each side was not so much defending a specific interest in Angola as playing out geo-political rivalry. The regional allies of the US continued to be Zaire and South Africa, while Congo-Brazzaville aligned itself with the Soviet Union. Cuba stepped up both military and civilian support to the MPLA government and contributed significantly to the rehabilitation of social sectors such as health and education.\nDiamonds, and more especially oil, provided the MPLA with the necessary revenue to function as a government. Foreign income also funded the lifestyle of the ruling elite and financed the ongoing war against UNITA. During the war years economic links between the coastal cities and the agrarian hinterland weakened almost to the point of extinction. Sometimes backed by South African forces, UNITA spasmodically occupied parts of the country, which became inaccessible to both government and merchants. The cities, especially Luanda, survived on imported food rather than home produce. Consumer goods were paid for by oil royalties. The neglected countryside was left to its own subsistence strategies. Over the years many people fleeing the war migrated to the towns. The lack of opportunities in the rural areas made prospects in the urban centres seem more attractive despite the poverty of the great slums. The city of Luanda grew to an estimated population of four million.\nThe 'second Angolan war' reached its peak in the mid-1980s. One of its enduring ironies concerned the dollar income generated by American oil companies, which paid for Cuban troops to protect the Angolan government and its oil installations from attacks by South African forces working for UNITA and partly financed by the US. In this phase of the war the battle for the small but strategic town of Cuito Cuanavale was a turning point. In 1987-88, South African and UNITA forces were pushed back by MPLA and Cuban troops after a long siege. The South Africans conceded that no military solution to the security of their northern border was possible and they started to explore political alternatives. The ensuing peace initiatives, orchestrated by a Troika of Portugal, America and Russia, finally resulted in the Bicesse Accords of May 1991 between the MPLA and UNITA. The peace was followed by the holding under UN auspices of Angola's first and only general election. Savimbi expected to gain power through the ballot box in September 1992. When he failed to do so he rejected the voting results and returned to war.\nThe 'third Angolan war' was even more brutal than its predecessors. Whole cities were reduced to ruins, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or died from war-related deprivation and disease, and millions were displaced, some for the second or even the third time. Extended talks in Lusaka finally resulted in another peace agreement, the Lusaka Protocol, signed in October 1994, but even then the war was not over. Despite international sanctions against UNITA's supply networks, Savimbi was reluctant to surrender the military option. After four years of neither peace nor war, the war erupted again with full ferocity in December 1998. The Angolan government, on paper a 'government of national unity and reconciliation' in which some UNITA dissident politicians participated under MPLA domination, pursued an offensive that culminated in the assassination of Jonas Savimbi in February 2002. On 4 April 2002, the Luena Memorandum marked the end of four decades of war and the ultimate defeat of UNITA. In October 2002, UNITA declared itself a fully disarmed and democratic political party and UN sanctions against it were lifted.\nPeace has characterised mainland Angola since April 2002, but in Cabinda, the enclave between the two Congo republics which accounts for sixty per cent of Angola's oil production, a war has continued unabated. The government has tried to replicate the strategy of scorched earth and starvation that had proved successful against UNITA. Many Cabindans nevertheless still support the rival movements demanding independence. The Angolan government, determined to preserve major economic assets, could never offer more than some form of provincial autonomy for the enclave. In October 2002, a major offensive against the Liberation Front of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) led to serious accusations of human rights abuses. Towards the end of 2003, after some FLEC defeats and defections, the Luanda government signalled that it was prepared to talk peace or even consider a referendum. So far, however, the silencing of the guns in mainland Angola has not reached Cabinda and the conflict remains unresolved. Peace in Angola remains incomplete. The physical and psychological scars of war are still evident. The democratic deficit has not been remedied. The regime is still marked by its predatory history.","title":"Angola from past to present | Conciliation Resources"},{"hasanswer":true,"id":"tc_8_1","score":"3.1937248706817627","text":"Angola\nFact Sheet\nSeptember 26, 2016\nMore information about Angola is available on the Angola Page and from other Department of State publications and other sources listed at the end of this fact sheet.\nU.S.-ANGOLA RELATIONS\nThe United States established diplomatic relations in 1993 with Angola, which had become independent from Portugal in 1975. Post-independence, Angola saw 27 years of civil war among groups backed at various times by countries that included the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, and South Africa. Angola has had two presidents since independence. The first president came to power in 1975; upon his 1979 death, the second president assumed power. Multiparty elections were held in 1992 under a process supervised by the United Nations, but the results were disputed and civil war continued until the 2002 death of one holdout guerilla leader. A new constitution was adopted in 2010 and elections were held in 2012.\nAngola has a strong and capable military. Although the country is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer and has great agricultural potential, two-thirds of the population live in poverty. U.S. foreign policy goals in Angola are to promote and strengthen Angola\u2019s democratic institutions, promote economic prosperity, improve health, and consolidate peace and security, including maritime security. The United States has worked with Angola to remove thousands of landmines and help war refugees and internally displaced people return to their homes.\nIn 2009 Secretary Clinton declared Angola a \u201cstrategic partner\u201d of the United States, one of three that the Obama Administration has identified on the African continent (the other two are Nigeria and South Africa). The U.S. \u2013 Angola Strategic Partnership Dialogue (SPD) was formalized with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in Washington in July 2010. Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Chikoti met for the first high level Strategic Dialogue in December 2014 in Washington, D.C. Secretary Kerry met President dos Santos during his visit to Luanda in May 2014.\nU.S. Assistance to Angola\nU.S. assistance seeks to focus on preventing major infectious diseases, strengthening health systems, increasing access to family planning and reproductive health services, and building capacity within nongovernmental organizations working in health advocacy and health service delivery. U.S. assistance also promotes stabilization and security sector reform.\nBilateral Economic Relations\nAngola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of its petroleum exports. U.S. imports from Angola are dominated by petroleum, with some diamonds. \u00a0U.S. exports to Angola include machinery, aircraft, poultry, and iron and steel products. Angola is a partner country with Power Africa. \u00a0Angola is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The United States and Angola have signed a trade and investment framework agreement, which seeks to promote greater trade and investment between the two countries.\nAngola's Membership in International Organizations\nAngola and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.

Bantu-speaking peoples from West Africa arrived in the region in the 13th cent., partially displacing the Khoisan and establishing a number of powerful kingdoms. The Portuguese first explored coastal Angola in the late 15th cent., and except for a short occupation (1641\u201348) by the Dutch, it was under Portugal's control until they left the country late in the 20th cent.\nAlthough they failed to discover the gold and other precious metals they were seeking, the Portuguese found in Angola an excellent source of slaves for their colony in Brazil. Portuguese colonization of Angola began in 1575, when a permanent base was established at Luanda. By this time the Mbundu kingdom had established itself in central Angola. After several attempts at subjugation, Portuguese troops finally broke the back of the kingdom in 1902, when the Bi\u00e9 Plateau was captured. Construction of the Benguela railroad followed, and white settlers arrived in the Angolan highlands.\nThe modern development of Angola began only after World War II. In 1951 the colony was designated an overseas province, and Portugal initiated plans to develop industries and hydroelectric power. Although the Portuguese professed the aim of a multiracial society of equals in Angola, most Africans still suffered repression. Inspired by nationalist movements elsewhere, the native Angolans rose in revolt in 1961. When the uprising was quelled by the Portuguese army, many fled to Congo (Kinshasa) and other neighboring countries.\nIn 1962 a group of refugees in the Congo, led by Holden Roberto, organized the Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA). It maintained supply and training bases in the Congo, waged guerrilla warfare in Angola, and, while developing contacts with both Western and Communist nations, obtained its chief support from the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Angola's liberation movement comprised two other guerrilla groups as well. The Marxist-influenced Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola (MPLA), founded in 1956, had its headquarters in Zambia and was most active among educated Angolan Africans and mesti\u00e7os living abroad. The MPLA led the struggle for Angolan independence. The third rival group was the Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA), which was established in 1966 under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi . As a result of the guerrilla warfare, Portugal was forced to keep more than 50,000 troops in Angola by the early 1970s.\nIn 1972 the heads of the FNLA and MPLA assumed joint leadership of a newly formed Supreme Council for the Liberation of Angola, but their military forces did not merge. That same year the Portuguese national assembly changed Angola's status from an overseas province to an \"autonomous state\" with authority over internal affairs; Portugal was to retain responsibility for defense and foreign relations. Elections were held for a legislative assembly in 1973.\nIn Apr., 1974, the Portuguese government was overthrown in a military uprising. In May of that year the new government proclaimed a truce with the guerrillas in an effort to promote peace talks. Later in the year Portugal seemed intent on granting Angola independence; however, the situation was complicated by the large number of Portuguese and other Europeans (estimated at 500,000) resident there, by continued conflict among the African liberation movements, and by the desire of some Cabindans for their oil-rich region to become independent as a separate.\nPostcolonial History\nPortugal granted Angola independence in 1975 and the MPLA assumed control of the government in Luanda; Agostinho Neto became president. The FNLA and UNITA, however, proclaimed a coaliton government in Nova Lisboa (now Huambo), but by early 1976 the MPLA had gained control of the whole country. Most of the European population fled the political and economic upheaval that followed independence, taking their investments and technical expertise with them. When Neto died in 1979, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos succeeded him as president. In the 1970s and 80s the MPLA government received large amounts of aid from Cuba and the Soviet Union, while the United States supported first the FNLA and then UNITA. In Cabinda, independence forces that had fought against the Portuguese now fought against the Angolan government. Although the FNLA faded in importance, UNITA obtained the support of South Africa, which was mounting its own campaigns against the Southwest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), a Namibian liberation group based in Angola.\nIn the late 1980s the United States provided military aid to UNITA and demanded the withdrawal of Cuban troops and an end to Soviet assistance. As a result of negotiations among Angola, South Africa, Cuba, and the United States, the withdrawal of Cuban troops began in 1989. Also in the late 1980s, Marxist Angola implemented programs of privatization under President dos Santos. A cease-fire between the ruling MPLA and UNITA was reached in 1991, and the government agreed to make Angola a multiparty state. However, when dos Santos won UN-supervised elections held in Sept., 1992, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi charged fraud and refused to accept the results. In Nov., 1992, bitter fighting broke out between rebel UNITA troops and government forces, destroying many cities and much of the country's infrastructure. Despite initial victories that gave UNITA control of some two thirds of Angola, the MPLA eventually gained the upper hand in the renewed warfare.\nIn Nov., 1994, with UNITA on the verge of defeat, dos Santos and Savimbi signed the Lusaka protocol, a new agreement on ending the conflict. The two sides committed to the integration of several thousand UNITA troops into the government armed forces as well as the demobilization of thousands more from both sides. UN peacekeeping troops began arriving in June, 1995, to supervise the process. Troop integration, however, was suspended in 1996, and UNITA's demobilization efforts lagged. A new government of national unity was formed in 1997, including several UNITA deputies; Savimbi had declined a vice presidency in 1996.\nWith renewed fighting in 1998, Angola's ruling MPLA put the country's coalition government on hold, saying that UNITA had failed to meet its peace-treaty obligations. It suspended all UNITA representatives from parliament and declared that it would no longer deal with Savimbi, instead recognizing a splinter group, UNITA Renovada. In 1999 the United Nations voted to pull out all remaining troops stationed in the country, while continuing humanitarian relief work with over a million refugees.\nUNITA was able to finance its activities, including an estimated 30,000 troops stationed in neighboring Zambia and Congo (Kinshasa), with some $500 million a year in diamond revenues from mines it controlled in the country's northeast. Fighting continued, with Angola's army inflicting several defeats on UNITA beginning in late 1999, weakening UNITA's still sizable forces. International restrictions (2001) on sales of diamonds not certfied as coming from legitimate sources also hurt UNITA, and the death of Savimbi in battle in 2002 was a severe blow to the rebels, who subsequently signed a cease-fire agreement and demobilized. UNITA subsequently reconstituted itself as a political party. Also in 2002 Angolan government forces gained the upper hand against Cabindan separatists; a peace agreement for the province was signed in 2006. As many as one million people died in the Angolan civil war, and the country's infrastructure was slow to recover from the effects of the fighting.\nParliamentary elections scheduled for 2007 were postponed late in 2006 until mid-2008, and the presidential election was then set for 2009. In Mar., 2007, there was an apparent attack on the leader of UNITA, Isaias Samakuva; UNITA accused the government of trying to assassinate him. When the parliamentary elections were finally held in Sept., 2008, they were marred by procedural irregulaties and difficulties but were otherwise generally transparent, and the MPLA won a landslide victory, with more than 80% of the vote.\nIn 2009 the presidential election (scheduled for Sept., 2009) was again postponed; a new constitution approved by the National Assembly in Jan., 2010, abolished direct election for the president. In the legislative elections of Aug., 2012, the MPLA won 72% of the vote, which thus resulted in the election of dos Santos as president. UNITA and other opposition parties unsuccessfully challenged the result in the courts.\nSections in this article:","title":"Angola: History - Infoplease"},{"hasanswer":true,"id":"tc_8_3","score":"4.526562452316284","text":"Milestones: 1969\u20131976 - Office of the Historian\nMilestones: 1969\u20131976\nThe Angola Crisis 1974\u201375\nAfter a successful military coup in Portugal that toppled a long-standing                     authoritarian regime on April 25, 1974, the new rulers in Lisbon sought to divest the country of its costly                     colonial empire. The impending independence of one of those colonies, Angola, led to the Angolan civil war that grew into a                     Cold War competition. The Angola crisis of 1974\u20131975 ultimately contributed to                     straining relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nCuban and Angolan soldiers are shown during a weapon practice session at a                         training center. (AP Photo)\nThree main military movements had been fighting for Angolan independence since                     the 1960s. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) was a                     Marxist organization centered in the capital, Luanda, and led by Agostinho Neto. The National Front for the Liberation                     of Angola (FNLA), led by Holden Roberto, was based in the                     north of the country and had strong ties to the U.S. ally, Mobutu Sese Seko, in                     neighboring Zaire. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola                     (UNITA), an offshoot of the FNLA, was led by Jonas Savimbi and supported by the                     country\u2019s largest ethnic group, the Ovimbundu. Following the Portuguese coup,                     these three revolutionaries met with representatives of the new Portuguese                     Government in January 1975 and signed the Alvor Agreement that granted Angolan                     independence and provided for a three-way power sharing government. However,                     trust quickly broke down among the three groups, and the country descended into                     civil war as each vied for sole power.\nThe crisis in Angola developed into a Cold War battleground as the superpowers                     and their allies delivered military assistance to their preferred clients. The                     United States supplied aid and training for both the FNLA and UNITA while troops                     from Zaire assisted Holden Roberto and his fighters. China, also, sent military                     instructors to train the FNLA. The Soviet Union provided military training and                     equipment for the MPLA. During the summer of 1975, the Soviet-supported MPLA was                     able to consolidate power in Luanda and oust the U.S.-supported FNLA from the                     capital, but the FNLA continued to attack. The remaining Portuguese troops                     failed to stem the violence. When MPLA leader Neto announced November 11, 1975                     as the day of Angolan independence, Lisbon decided to withdraw its troops on                     that day.\nThe MPLA also had long-established relations with Fidel                         Castro\u2019s Cuba. Before November 11, the MPLA had negotiated with                     Castro for Cuban assistance. At the same time, UNITA, which enjoyed U.S.                     support, approached the Apartheid government in South Africa for military                     reinforcement. Pretoria, with the aim to end the use of Angola as a base for                     rebels fighting for the independence of South Africa-occupied Namibia,                     contributed forces that entered southern Angola in October and made rapid                     progress toward the capital. In response, Castro sent Cuban Special Forces to                     halt the South African advance and succeeded in drawing attention to the fact                     that the United States had provided support to a group that now accepted                     assistance from an Apartheid government.\nThe U.S. Government had encouraged the South African intervention, but preferred                     to downplay its connection with the Apartheid regime. However, once Pretoria\u2019s                     involvement became widely known, the Chinese withdrew its advisers from the                     region, and the Ford Administration was faced with domestic resistance to the                     U.S. role in the Angolan conflict. President Gerald Ford had requested                     Congressional approval for more money to fund the operation in Angola. However,                     many members of Congress were wary of intervening abroad after the struggle in                     Vietnam, others wished to avoid the South Africa connection, and still others                     did not believe the issue was important. In the end, Congress rejected the                     President\u2019s request for additional funds. South Africa withdrew its forces in                     the spring of 1976 and the MPLA remained as the official government of Angola.                     Still, Jonas Savimbi and UNITA continued an insurgency until his death in 2002.\nDuring the period of the Angolan crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union                     were still enjoying a brief thaw in their relations, in an era referred to as d\u00e9tente . During this time,                     Washington and Moscow had reached a series of agreements that aimed to reduce                     tensions between the two superpowers. However, by 1974, strains on bilateral                     relations had already compromised U.S. support for d\u00e9tente and the crisis in                     Angola served to accelerate this trend. From the U.S. point of view, one of the                     aims of d\u00e9tente was to draw the Soviet Union further into the international                     system so that Washington could induce Moscow to show restraint in its dealings                     with the Third World. The Ford Administration believed that Cuba had intervened                     in Angola as a Soviet proxy and as such, the general view in Washington was that                     Moscow was breaking the rules of d\u00e9tente. The appearance of a Soviet success and                     a U.S. loss in Angola on the heels of a victory by Soviet-supported North                     Vietnam over U.S.-supported South Vietnam continued to erode U.S. faith in                     d\u00e9tente as an effective Cold War foreign policy.\nThe U.S. failure to achieve its desired outcome in Angola raised the stakes of                     the superpower competition in the Third World. Subsequent disagreements over the                     Horn of Africa, and Afghanistan contributed to undoing the period of d\u00e9tente                     between the Soviet Union and the United States. Additionally, the Angola crisis                     also ended a recent thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations.","title":"The Angola Crisis 1974\u201375 - State"},{"hasanswer":true,"id":"tc_8_4","score":"3.2491276264190674","text":"Angolan Civil War (1975-2002) | The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed\nAngolan Civil War (1975-2002)\nAngolan Soldier in front of Soviet Missiles\nImage Ownership: Public Domain\nThe Angolan Civil War, beginning at the time of the country's independence from Portugal in 1975, was a 27-year struggle involving the deaths of over 500,000 soldiers and civilians.\u00a0 Initiated at the height of the Cold War, pro- and anti- communist forces in Angola set the stage for a proxy fight between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) .\u00a0 Though the fighting officially ended in 2002, Angola remains in economic and social turmoil with a massive refugee crisis and millions of landmines impeding farming practices.\nRich in diamonds and oil, Angola was one of the last African nations to receive independence from a European power.\u00a0 On April 25, 1974, a Portuguese military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat protesting the country\u2019s colonial practices successfully overthrew the regime.\u00a0 The combined forces of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) created a transitional government with the Alvor Accord of 1974.\nWithin a year the government had disintegrated, and with aid from the USSR and the Cuban military, the Marxist-oriented MPLA under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 dos Santos had wrested control of most of Angola.\u00a0 Indirectly and through proxies, governments from the United States, Brazil and South Africa funded UNITA, providing munitions, intelligence reports, and mercenaries.\nHeavy fighting continued until 1991 when a temporary agreement known as the Bicesse Accords was reached.\u00a0 Calling for an immediate ceasefire and the removal of both Cuban and South African troops, the agreement mandated a new national government and army, along with Angola\u2019s first multi-party elections.\u00a0 A year later, MPLA candidate Jos\u00e9 dos Santos won 49% of the popular vote in the election compared to 40% for UNITA candidate Dr. Jonas Savimbi .\u00a0 When Savimbi disputed the outcome, UNITA resumed guerilla war against the MPLA.\nIn 1993 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 864 placing an embargo on petroleum and munitions shipments to UNITA.\u00a0 UNITA continued military operations until Savimbi was killed in an ambush in February of 2002.\u00a0 Officially demobilized that August under less-radical leadership, UNITA has since been a formidable political party in Angolan politics.\nThough a country rich in natural resources, Angola was economically and politically devastated with runaway inflation of the country\u2019s currency (the kwanza), a national crisis of amputees from the millions of landmines, and political fallout from the millions of refugees displaced from the fighting.\nSources:\nKevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African History (New York: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005); Fernando Andresen Guimaraes, The Origins of the Angolan Civil War: Foreign Intervention and Domestic Political Conflict (London: Macmillan Press, 1997); John A.

At 24 years of age, young Soul joined a North Dakota musical revue, was noticed by a keen-eyed talent scout, and signed to a studio contract. He went on to study acting with the Irene Daly School of The Actors Company, and with the Columbia Workshop in Hollywood. He first appeared on TV in small roles in shows including I Dream of Jeannie (1965), Flipper (1964) and All in the Family (1971). Regular TV work kept coming in for Soul including making masked appearances on The Merv Griffin Show (1962), as the popular singer known only as \"The Covered Man.\"\nIn 1973, Soul was fortunate enough to be cast as one of the corrupt motorcycle cops in the Clint Eastwood thriller Magnum Force (1973), where his talents came to the attention of several TV execs who were looking for someone to play one of the lead roles in the upcoming Starsky and Hutch (1975) TV series. After four seasons, the show came to an end, yet Soul's talents were still in demand. He quickly went on to appear as the meek writer turned terrified vampire hunter Ben Mears in the chilling television mini-series Salem's Lot (1979), and then as Jake in the interesting television movie Homeward Bound (1980).\nSeveral undemanding movies and TV series appearances followed for Soul. However in 1988 he scored rave reviews for his portrayal of real life, cold-blooded cop killer Michael Lee Platt in In the Line of Duty: The F.B.I. Murders (1988). It was considered highly controversial for its intense level of violence in a made for TV production.\nDavid Soul remained very busy throughout the 1990's and beyond, in both film and on stage productions. He has toured internationally in several theater productions, including playing the narrator in the critically-acclaimed production of Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, plus a successful UK tour performing in Ira Levin's Deathtrap. Fans of the original TV series were glad to see Soul back with Paul Michael Glaser doing a cameo appearance in the big-budget movie version of Starsky & Hutch (2004).\nThroughout his life, Soul has continually championed social causes often utilizing his own funds to raise awareness on issues including the impact of the Vietnam War, the shutdowns in the US steel industry, animal welfare, world hunger and HIV education. Soul has for several years made his home in the United Kingdom, where he has appeared at the Edinburgh Festival, on several British TV shows and has become a keen soccer fan supporting English club, Arsenal FC.\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: firehouse44@hotmail.com\nSpouse (5)\n( 7 December \u00a01963            -  1965)\u00a0(divorced)\u00a0(1 child)\nTrivia (24)\nUsed to appear on The Merv Griffin Show (1962) wearing a hood and was billed as \"The Covered Man\" before becoming nationally known on Starsky and Hutch (1975).\nChildren: with Mirriam - one son; with Karen Carlson - one son; with Patti - one, as well as the two sons she previously had with Bobby Sherman ; and with Julia Nickson - one daughter, China Soul .\nHis brother, the Rev.

Dr. Solberg's job was to administrate relief to the tens of thousands of refugees who were fleeing oppressive regimes and then try to put the fragmented families back together again in the West. These early experiences proved to be indelible ones for David as hundreds of these people streamed through the Solberg home.\nBetween 1977 and 1982, he recorded four albums, which included a string of major hit singles: Don't Give Up On Us, Baby; Silver Lady; and Going In with my Eyes Open. He toured extensively with his band in the USA, UK, Japan and South America.\nBetween 1984 and 1986, David financed, produced and directed an award-winning documentary, The Fighting Ministers, which uses the shut-down of the steel industry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as its basis.\nIn 1994, David has refocused his acting and producing efforts specifically to the burgeoning international film and television markets.

His production incorporated pre-shot and live on-stage video, visual effects, graphics, 3-D imaging, time-lapse footage and digital sound to heighten the visceral experience of the presentation.

[November 2000]\nPersonal Quotes (24)\n[on Starsky & Hutch (2004)] In a word, I thought it sucked.\nI believe that a parent's role is to provide a path or opportunity for their children.\nMy father was my main influence. He was a preacher, but he was also a history and political science teacher, and since he was my hero, I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a teacher.\nNobody teaches you to be a father. Nobody teaches you to be a husband. Nobody teaches you how to be a star. You have to learn to work with the tools.\nOne of my beliefs is that there are certain institutions within a community which stand for the spirit and heart of that community, there's the church, the local football team, the local pub and the theatre.\nSometimes I feel an obligation to be accessible as a personality, but for me the driving force since the beginning has always been good work, taking risks, trying new things. If the door opens, go through it. Always go forwards.\nI was an accidental actor. I was never formally trained.\nBeing on the move all the time is draining, but the rewards make up for it.\nA job is a very healthy thing to do.\nIt's only when gravity starts to take over you begin to think about your body.\nI like to eat and I love the diversity of foods.\nThe most important thing is story-telling. It's as singular and old-fashioned as that.\nMusic always came first. I never set out to be an actor.\nIt's important to move the theatre into the 21st Century.\nIf these theatres didn't exist, the tradition of British theatre would cease to exist.\nI was born into a family of preachers.\nOnce in a while I'll get moved to do some exercise. It's something I long for but the biggest problem is bending down and putting my tennis shoes on. Once I go out I'm OK.\nI went into acting because I had to make a good living. I had a child now and I had to support him any way I could... I wasn't happy, but I wasn't unhappy. I was just doing what I had to do to survive.\nI was never jailed. The fact is that I was arrested, but I went into a diversion programme, and by that time I'd already begun working in what was called anger management. It was a painful and awful moment.\nAt only 20 years old I got married. I was still a kid myself, but in those times, if you got someone pregnant, you had no choice but to get married. So I left school and the only thing I could do was sing.\nYes, your home is your castle, but it is also your identity and your possibility to be open to others.\nTo deal with the stark reality of having hit or hurt a woman or child, to deal with the initial responsibility you have not to do that and the knowledge you did do it, can be incredibly hard.\nPeople thought me a bit strange at first; a blond haired, blue-eyed Norwegian who sang Mexican folk songs, but I used it to my advantage and got a job. And so the music became my ticket to education.\nPaul and I were both struggling actors. One night he would serve me in a restaurant, and the next night I would serve him. It was what out of work actors did.\nSee also","title":"David Soul - Biography - IMDb"}]}
