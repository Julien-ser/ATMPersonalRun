The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L.\u00a0Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and \"The Simpsons Pinball Party\" (2003). Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as \"Bartman: Avenger of Evil\" (1990) and \"Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis\" (1991).",

It was written by John Ortved, and first published in October 2009 by Faber and Faber. In the United Kingdom, the book is called Simpsons Confidential: The uncensored, totally unauthorised history of the world's greatest TV show by the people that made it. The book is an oral history of the show, and concentrates particularly on the writers and producers of the show. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as creator Matt Groening and James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, who helped develop the series. According to National Public Radio reviewer Linda Holmes, \"Ortved's thesis, essentially, is that lots of people are responsible for the success of \"The Simpsons\", and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised.\"",

She won two Grand Slam Doubles Titles and was a quarter finalist in singles at the U.S. Open and The French Open. Her father Jerry, a well known coach, helped Margaret Court win the coveted Grand Slam (all four Grand Slam titles in one year) in 1970 and Virginia Wade to her 1977 Wimbledon triumph. Teeguarden was voted the \"Most Watchable Player\" based on play and appearance by a group of Madison Avenue advertising executives or \"Mad Men\" while playing at the US Open. Teeguarden played in 19 consecutive US Opens, holding the record until Chris Evert played in 20. She wore the first all black outfit in the history of tennis in 1975 at The Bridgestone Doubles Championships in Tokyo, starting a trend that is still popular today. Teeguarden was the first woman tennis player signed by Nike. She played on the victorious Los Angeles Strings Team Tennis team in 1981 and won the Team Tennis Mixed Doubles Division with Tom Gullikson in 1977; they were also runners-up in the league that year.",

However, the trial was unsuccessful in indicting Sir von Hagenbach with the charge of rape because the war in which the rapes occurred was \"undeclared\" and thus the rapes were only considered illegal. Gender-targeted crimes continued to be prosecuted, but it was not until after World War II when an international criminal tribunal- the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo Tribunal)- were officers charged for being responsible of the gender-targeted crimes (particularly rape) and other crimes against humanity. Despite the various rape charges, the Charter of the Tokyo Tribunal did not make references to rape, and rape was considered as subordinate to other war crimes. This is also the situation for other tribunals that followed, but with the establishments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there was more attention to the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes with each of the statutes explicitly referring to rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence.",

Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: \"rapping\" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art, which he called \"aerosol writin'\", although many say that the graffiti that hip hop adopted had been around years earlier, and had nothing to do with hip hop culture.

Alongside descriptions of historical events, the stories often contain mythical elements. Pantun were originally not written down, the bards often being illiterate and in many cases blind. Originally the performances had a sacred character, as was clear from the offerings made at the beginning of the recitation and also from the content of the introductory part of the story, called rajah, which was an invocatory song, imploring the help of divine figures to ward off bad influences. The linguistic form of the pantun was not strictly fixed, however the dominant form employed in most pantun is the octosyllabic verse.

Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including multiple genres of heavy metal. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs. Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound. DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds.

Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the \"Virginius\", a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C.

It was Hole's only album to feature bassist Kristen Pfaff before her death in June 1994. Recorded in October 1993, the album marked a divergence from the band's unpolished hardcore aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure, and features production by Sean Slade and Paul Q.

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action. The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era. Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea. Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system. Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support. South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union. The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops. North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested. This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea. North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.",

Originally, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor was split into five individual unions of bakers, cigar makers, printers, tailors, and carpenters. Now they represent over 300 unions, about 800,000 people, throughout Los Angeles County, making it the second largest in the country. \u201cA survey published in December 2003 showed that the three largest unions in the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor were SEIU 434B (with seventy-four thousand homecare and nursing home workers), SEIU 399 with forty-five thousand health care and other employees, and the United Teachers of Los Angeles (with thirty thousand teachers from the American Federation and the National Education Association).\u201d They have helped make Los Angeles a union city. Their mission is to \u201c promote a voice for workers through organizing themselves into unions, building strong coalitions of labor, community, faith, and responsible businesses, engaging in both organizing and political campaigns, electing pro-union and pro-worker candidates and advancing public policies that support workers, families and local communities.\u201d They also encourage people to help make change by voting. The Los Angeles County Federation of labor is a major focal point for new American labor movement. Recently, the impressive progression of Los Angeles becoming a union city has become a stand out model for other non-union cities because of Los Angeles\u2019 anti-union history. Los Angeles combines the economic development activism and the refined political work of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.",

It is the northernmost of twelve municipalities that form Quind\u00edo, the second smallest department of Colombia. It houses a small community economically supported by agriculture and tourism. Although coffee is the major agricultural product, the municipality's diverse ecosystem makes it perfect for the production of numerous fruits and vegetables. The population is evenly split between the urban and rural areas, with an urban population in the town of Filandia itself of nearly 7000 inhabitants and a population of around 6500 in the rest of the municipality. Most of the population is classified as mestizo (63,2%) and the most common religion is Roman Catholic. The town's architecture, landscapes and the sociability of the locals makes Filandia one of the most beautiful and attractive towns in the department of Quindio and the nation. The town's best-known tourist attractions are its \"mirador\" (viewing tower) with its extensive views over the Cauca River valley to the west and the Parque Nacional Natural los Nevados to the east (it is also possible to see both Armenia and Pereira from the top of the tower), and the cafe in the main square where scenes from the popular Colombian telenovela \"Cafe, con aroma de mujer\" were filmed.",

She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America. In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era. She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. In her essay \u201cUtilization of Women in City Government,\u201d Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women\u2019s roles in the private sphere. Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman \"public philosopher in the history of the United States. In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU. In 1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and is recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States.",

She organized these narratives into \"rooms\", and each is identified by the woman's first name, except for the last chapter, \"odd notes\", which is presented as the \"fleeting thoughts\" of many anonymous women. The book revealed that women fantasize, just as men do, and that the content of the fantasies can be as transgressive, or not, as men's. The book, the first published compilation of women's sexual fantasies, refuted many previously accepted notions of female sexuality.",

The cast also included David Manners, to whom Brando has attributed much of his subsequent success, and Kevin McCarthy. The play is noted for Brando's first major appearance on Broadway, during which he garnered attention for an unusually intense performance which presaged his later work on \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". \"Truckline Cafe\" is also notable for being the first collaboration between Brando and Kazan, who later made \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"Viva Zapata\", and \"On the Waterfront\" together.

Henry Stout bought a quarter interest in the company in 1853, and its name became Knapp, Stout & Company. The company's location allowed it to control the lumber industry in the region, and by 1870 it controlled the logging industry in the Red Cedar River valley. In 1878, the company incorporated, and its official name became the Knapp, Stout & Co., Company. The company employed over 2,000 workers in the Menomonie area and produced 85 million board feet of lumber on average yearly from 1871 to 1896; its output made it the largest lumber company in the world. In the 1880s, the company expanded to sites along the Mississippi River, opening offices in Dubuque, Iowa, Read's Landing, Minnesota, and St. Louis. By the 1900s, the company had largely depleted its lumber supply; it closed many of its camps and dissolved early in the 20th century.

Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Syncros had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts. In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S. based bicycle company GT. Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts. Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the Syncros brand name, and used the Syncros label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation. Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the Syncros brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham. However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name.",

In 1683, prior to the creation of modern towns, the Province of New York was divided into twelve counties for administrative purposes by the Colonial Governor of New York. In the Hudson Valley, these divisions included Dutchess, Orange, and Ulster counties. Dutchess and Orange remained unorganized until 1713, with Dutchess administered from Ulster; Orange would be administered from New York County. Future counties would be formed and towns exchanged over time, with Rockland County split from Orange in 1799, at which time the southern towns of Ulster were transferred to Orange as compensation for the loss; and Putnam County from Dutchess in 1812, these county's towns can trace their origins to towns and precincts that were formed in their parent counties. Another change that occurred was the transfer of Dutchess County's northern section, the Livingston Manor, to Columbia County. Greene County was formed in 1800 by the combination of the southernmost towns of Albany County with the northernmost towns of Ulster. The history of the towns of Greene and Columbia counties can be found at the Timeline of town creation in New York's Capital District.",

CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in \"actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law\". The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance. In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers. There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak in the sense that they are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance. 'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law. The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions.

The album was re-released in 1992 by Silva Screen records as \"Earthshock - Classic Music From The BBC Radiophonic Workshop Volume 1\", with bonus tracks including \"The World of Doctor Who\", a track recorded by Mills as a B-side to Dudley Simpson's 1973 \"\"Moonbase 3\"\" single, which featured a mix of music from the serial \"The Mind of Evil\" with sound effects from \"Planet of the Daleks\" before finishing with Simpson's \"Master's Theme\".

They are arranged according to requirements, and stored when not in use. The earliest royal coaches date back to the mid-19th Century in the reign of Queen Victoria; until an upgrade in 1977 there were multiple sets based in different regions, a legacy of the pre-nationalisation era of railways in Britain. Many are now in museums or on heritage railways; the National Railway Museum in York has a royal themed exhibition. Dedicated locomotives have never traditionally been part of the Royal Train, first appearing in special livery only in the 1990s, but also seeing use on other trains since 2003. In the 21st Century, various preserved (and one new build) steam locomotives have also hauled the train on special occasions. Although regularly cited by critics as one of the unnecessary luxuries of the Royal Family, which has led to an increase in the alternate use of normal scheduled services where possible, supporters argue the current arrangement emphasizes utility over luxury, and is still often the most practical and secure mode of travel to fit the required itinerary and avoid disruption to the public.",

Speaking at the Jesuit university, he was likely making reference to the Ivy League, an athletic conference established in 1954. The term \"Jesuit Ivy\" was somewhat of a contradiction in terms. The Ivy League's members were generally Protestant-founded institutions; Boston College had itself been founded in part because Catholics were being denied admission to Harvard University in the nineteenth century. The nickname suggested both Boston College's rising stature and the declining prevalence of discrimination at elite American universities. Kennedy, a Catholic whose family were longtime Boston College benefactors, graduated from Harvard in 1940; as did his father in 1912, and his brothers Joe Jr, Robert and Edward in 1938, 1948 and 1956 respectively.",

He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal. Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack. Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career. Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself. By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's \"I Got Skillz\" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials. Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend. Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with \"Still a G Thang,\" one of the better songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told. Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop\u2014Tru's \"It's a Beautiful Thang,\" Silkk the Shocker's \"Get It Up\"\u2014before playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: \"In Love With a Thug,\" \"Better Days,\" \"Gangsta Ride,\" among others. In 2000 he reprised his role as one of Snoop's producers of choice, producing tracks for Tha Eastsidaz' self-titled debut and Doggy's Angels' Pleezbalevit, as well as Snoop's own Tha Last Meal (\"Go Away,\" \"Issues\").",

The Fortean Society was primarily based in New York City. Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort, who had helped to get his work published. Founding members of The Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott (and many of NYC's literati such as Dorothy Parker), and Baltimore writer H. L. Mencken. Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller. The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser. Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues. Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean. During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics. Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens. In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.",

Prior to 1999, it was called simply the NFL Man of the Year Award. Shortly after Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton died (having been the 1977 recipient himself), the award was renamed to honor his legacy as a humanitarian. Each year, a winner is selected from 32 nominees from the 32 different teams. A panel of judges, which includes the Commissioner of the NFL, Connie Payton (widow of Walter Payton), the previous year's winner, and a number of former players select the winner of the award. The Man of the Year winner receives a $50,000 donation in his name to a charity of his choice. The other 31 finalists also receive donations in their name of $5,000 each to charities of their choice. The Chicago Bears and Kansas City Chiefs have had more winners of the award than any other team, with 5 winners each. The winners for the 2016 award are New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.",

She also wrote for \"Executive Suite\" and \"Fish\", a 1977-78 spin-off from \"Barney Miller\". With Barbara Corday, Avedon created \"Cagney & Lacey\", the world's first dramatic television series to place women in both of its starring roles. They came up with the idea for this television series after having read Molly Haskell's book \"From Reverence to Rape\" which stated that there had never been a female buddy film. Avedon and Corday initially intended \"Cagney & Lacey\" to be a film. While they were writing the series together, Avedon was more experienced and proficient in screenwriting than Corday, and Avedon mentored Corday in this area throughout the series.

It was first granted by writ to Thomas II de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245\u20131321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued. The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron's nephew and heir James Berkeley. His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488. He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquesate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed \"de jure\" to his younger brother Maurice. However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol. Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs. Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII's unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family. Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were \"de jure\" barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming \"de facto\" 7th Baron in 1553.

The album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended to be the first in a trilogy of solo albums by Blue \u00d6yster Cult drummer and songwriter Albert Bouchard. Bouchard was fired in August 1981, and CBS rejected the album in 1984, but a re-worked version was eventually published as a product of the band. Many musicians contributed to the project over this eight-year span, including Joe Satriani and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, but some band members were barely involved in the recording process.

About the relation between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, it is necessary to point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs; however it is clear that they had a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script derives from southeastern Iberian script. In fact, the southeastern Iberian script is very similar, both considering the shape of the signs or their values, to the Southwestern script used to represent an unknown language usually named Tartessian. The main difference is that southeastern Iberian script doesn\u2019t show the vocalic redundancy of the syllabic signs. Unlike the northeastern Iberian script the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not yet complete, because there are a significant number of signs on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus. Despite it is believed that unlike the northeastern Iberian script the southeastern Iberian script doesn\u2019t show any system to differentiate between voiced and unvoiced occlusives, a recent paper (Ferrer i Jan\u00e9 2010) defends the existence of a dual system also in the southeastern Iberian script.",

Cripps was sent to negotiate an agreement with the nationalist leaders, speaking for the majority Hindu population, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, speaking for the minority Muslim population. Cripps worked to keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for a promise of full self-government after the war. Cripps promised to give dominion status after the war as well as elections to be held after the war. Cripps discussed the proposals with the Indian leaders and published them. Both the major parties, the Congress and the League rejected his proposals and the mission proved a failure. Cripps had designed the proposals himself, but they were too radical for both Churchill and the Indians; no middle way was found. Congress moved towards the Quit India movement whereby it refused to cooperate in the war effort, while the British imprisoned practically the entire Congress leadership for the duration of the war.

The Disney tradition of including transport by rail in its parks has since been extended to other Disney properties with the opening of Walt Disney World in Florida in the United States, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, Disneyland Paris in France, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort in China, and Shanghai Disney Resort in China.",

As an operator of a gas van, Laabs was directly involved in and responsible for the genocidal extermination of over 100,000 men, women and children, most of whom were killed on account of being Jewish. After the war, he was tried and convicted for his crimes against humanity. Despite being convicted, Laabs was given the lenient sentence of 15 years (subsequently reduced to 13 years) by a regional court in Landgericht Bonn, Germany. Far from being outliers, such instances of leniency, extended to perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity during trials in post-Nazi Germany, constituted the norm, as evidenced by the fact that most of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes and the Final Solution were not brought to justice. Many former SS officers and Nazis, who were directly responsible for perpetrating genocide and murdering countless innocent people, were contracted to work for US and British intelligence agencies as part of the war against the USSR and Communism (also see Operation Paperclip for more on post-WWII Allied collaboration with Nazis).",

A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934.

It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board\u2019s headquarters in Edinburgh. Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle. Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used.",

The first Anglo-Saxon settlers, the Magons\u00e6tan, were a sub-tribal unit of the Hwicce who occupied the Severn valley. The Magons\u00e6tan were said to be in the intervening lands between the Rivers Wye and Severn. The undulating hills of marl clay were surrounded by the Welsh mountains to the west; the Malvern Hills to the east; the Clent Hills of the Shropshire borders to the north, and the indeterminate extent of the Forest of Dean to the south. The shire name first recorded in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was derived from \"Here-ford\", Old English for \"Army crossing\", the location for the city. The area was covered first by Offa of Mercia, who constructed the dyke as a boundary to keep warring tribes out of the Mercian kingdom: an early indication of the ambivalent relations with the Welsh. The shire as an administrative unit was developed from Alfred the Great's Burghal Hidage, and the Shire-reeve courts of the Hundred. King Edgar the \u00c6theling was a regular visitor, and founded the diocese, previously part of the see of Worcester, in 976. The establishment of a centre of law and justice was supported by a monastic chapter that flourished during the Tenth century Reformation. Hereford's geographical location at the hub of the shire allowed Anglo-Saxon ealdormen to manage affairs; and Hereford played a vital role in the Scandinavian wars until Ralph, Earl Hereford was deposed by the regal Earl Harold Godwinson.",

He died on 11 June 1982. He was popularly known as 'Fakhr-e-Kashmir' (pride of Kashmir) and was the architect of the legendary 'land to the landless tiller' legislation which uplifted the masses of J&K. His legal acumen and genius was admired by friends and foes. He was also known as the brain behind Sheikh Abdullah. His legal acumen was lauded by the imminent legal luminary G.S. Pathak, who later became the Vice President of India, who proclaimed \"Beg Sahab, you come out of politics and be a permanent part of the legal profession, you can be a jewel of any Bar\" (after hearing his arguments in the Kashmir Conspiracy case). He was immensely popular amongst his people and was perceived as the successor to Sheikh Mohd. Abdullah. He served as the first Deputy Chief Minister of the state of J&K and was seen discharging the most important functions in the State with his sheer brilliance. Historians of JK Politics hold him solely for National Conference's landslide win in the 1977 assembly elections when he single-handedly ran the NC's campaign. He is survived by three sons and three daughters. His eldest son Dr Mirza Mohammad Aijaz beg is a very renowned medico and has served state government for about forty years and retired as Deputy director health services. He is the only son who has been residing at ancestral place throughout. He was never interested in politics and has got a great rapport of being pious and honest administrator and human being.

Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event. Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event. They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding. Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (\"Psorothamnus spinosus\"), desert willow (\"Chilopsis linearis\"), catclaw (\"Senegalia greggii\"), cheesebush (\"Ambrosia salsola\"), and waterweed (\"Baccharis sergiloides\").",

There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.",

Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.",

Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.

Other communities along Horse Creek include Graniteville, Warrenville, Gloverville, Langley, Burnettown, Bath, and Clearwater. While Horse Creek itself is rather insignificant, its potential for water power led to early examples of Southern industrialization, including a textile mill at Vaucluse (1830) and William Gregg's Graniteville Mill (1845). The textile industry continued to play a primary role until the Graniteville Train Derailment and final closure of the Graniteville Mill in 2006.",

The Penny Post was established in 1680 by William Dockwra and his business partner, Robert Murray. Dockwra was a merchant and a member of the Armourer and Brasiers Livery Company and was appointed a Customs Under-Searcher for the Port of London in 1663. Murray would later become clerk in the excise office of the Penny Post. The London Penny Post mail service was launched with weeks of publicity preceding it on 27 March 1680. The new London Penny Post provided the city of London with a much needed inter-city mail delivery system. The new Penny Post was influential in establishing a model system and pattern for the various Provincial English Penny Posts in the years that followed. It was the first postal system to use hand-stamps to postmark the mail to indicate the place and time of the mailing and that its postage had been prepaid. The success of the Penny Post would also threaten the interests of the Duke of York who profited directly from the existing general post office. It also compromised the business interests of porters and private couriers. The Penny Post was also involved in publishing various criticisms towards the British monarchy, the Duke of York in particular, which ultimately led to the take over of the Penny Post by crown authorities. The earliest known Penny Post postmark is dated 13 December 1680 and is considered by some to be the world's first postage 'stamp'.",

The Minotaur was nursed by Queen Pasiphae as a child but grew to devour humans, so he was safely put away in the maze contrived so carefully and trickily that it was impossible for anyone that entered to navigate or escape it. The Athenians were forced to pay a tribute to King Minos by sacrificing seven of their maidens and seven of their men, unarmed, to the Minotaur every nine years. The Minotaur eventually fell prey to the sword of Theseus. It is also rumoured that the Minotaur was in fact the offspring of King Minos but his unsightly and grotesque appearance was shameful to King Minos and was the reason why the Minotaur was banished under the pretext of inspiring fear and cannibalistic capabilities.",

According to some sources that title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet, Sir Gillis Payne, in 1801. Sir Gillis was in a relationship with a farmer's daughter, Maria Keeling. They apparently married in 1761 although several children had been born before this date. Peter Payne was the eldest son born after the marriage and would normally have succeeded in the title. However, he allowed his eldest brother John Payne to assume the title, although John was illegitimate. John died in 1803 when his son Charles assumed the title. However, in 1828 Peter Payne raised the question in the courts over who was the rightful baronet. The Court of Chancery declared that he was the rightful heir to his father, but this was overturned by the Lord Chancellor in 1829. Nonetheless, during his lifetime Sir Peter was universally acknowledged as a baronet. Most reference books on the British nobility and baronetage include the title, although they describe it as being in dispute between rival branches of the family. Charles Robert Salusbury Payne, the supposed sixth Baronet, appears to have discontinued the claim around 1900.",

Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as \"Nature\" publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity. Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method. If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results.

Genge is most famous for his role as the shotgun toting gray-haired mob hitman 'Mike' in the 1968 film \"Bullitt\" (his character is the passenger in the black 1968 Dodge Charger during the famous car chase that goes out of control and causes his death and the driver's). Other film roles include that of a payoff man in \"The Outfit\" (1973), a California Highway Patrol officer in 1967's \"Hot Rods to Hell\", Whitey, a communist suspect in \"The FBI Story\" (1959) and Lieutenant Hagerman in \"North By Northwest\" (1959). He also appeared on many television shows from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He played in four episodes of \"Perry Mason\", starring Raymond Burr; in three of the roles he played a law-enforcement officer, such as San Francisco Inspector Wade in \"The Case of the Poison Pen Pal\" in 1962. In his final appearance in 1966 he played Bud in \"The Case of the Sausalito Sunrise.\" Ironically, in that episode he and his comrade, in attempting to hijack goods from a truck driven by Paul Drake, are killed when their car loses control and rolls down the cliff, somewhat similar to the chase scene in \"Bullitt\".",

The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising. Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality. The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.

It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33\u2153-rpm album. The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world. The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish. The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale. From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations. Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released. This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution. Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas. \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953. In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album. For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released. That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's. M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1. For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play. So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled. In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release. Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller. Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order. Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\" That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Sagle. This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases.",

However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World. By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.",

It openly rejected some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases. It also sought to \"reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice.\" It stated that it was \"dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine\" and that its members \"confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery.\" \"While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers.\" The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession.

The sources say that Pakistan allowed Chinese officials to examine the Black Hawk wreckage.

A series of more practical airships was constructed by Ernest Willows, the \"Willows Number 1\" making its first flight near Cardiff on 5 August 1905. The Royal Navy realised that airships similar to Ferdinand von Zeppelin's designs could be of great use and in 1909 ordered construction of a rigid airship. This was completed in 1911 but was wrecked while leaving the hangar before it had flown. Meanwhile, the British Army's School of Ballooning, later the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, acquired a small fleet of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships for observation purposes; they were taken over by the Royal Navy on the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914. A large number of rigid and non-rigid airships were mainly used to counter the U-Boat campaign in World War I. Interest in military airships declined at the end of the war, but some success in the commercial field inspired the Imperial Airship Scheme; however, the disastrous crash of the R101 in 1930 ended serious government and commercial interest in airships. Since the 1970s, there have been persistent efforts to revive a British airship industry, using new designs, materials and technologies.",

It also features the first appearance of Jos\u00e9 Carioca, the Brazilian cigar-smoking parrot. \"Saludos Amigos\" was popular enough that Walt Disney decided to make another film about Latin America, \"The Three Caballeros\", to be produced two years later. \"Saludos Amigos\" premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. At 42 minutes, it is Disney's shortest animated feature to date.

About 30,000 people disappeared, many of which were impossible to be formally reported due to the nature of the issue: state terrorism. The targets were left-wing activists, guerrillas and militants, trade unionists, students, journalists and Marxists and Peronist guerrillas and their support network in the Montoneros believed to be 150,000-250,000-strong and 60,000-strong in the ERP, as well as alleged sympathizers. Some 10,000 of the \"disappeared\" were guerrillas of the Montoneros (MPM) and the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) although the lowest estimate is that the Montoneros and ERP had a combined strength of 5,000. The \"disappeared\" included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta, even vaguely, and they were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas. The worst repression reportedly occurred after the guerillas were largely defeated in 1977, when the church, labor unions, artists, intellectuals and university students and professors were targeted. Although the Montoneros reported having carried out some 600 armed attacks in 1977, the guerrilla threat had greatly declined. The junta justified this mass terror by exaggerating the guerrilla threat, and even staged attacks to be blamed on guerillas and used frozen dead bodies of guerilla fighters that had been kept in storage for this purpose. In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup. That year, a special study by the New York City Bar concluded that around 10,000 Argentines had disappeared since the coup. According to \"Registro Unificado de V\u00edctimas del Terrorismo de Estado\" (Ruvte), 662 were disappeared under the presidency of Isabel Per\u00f3n and 6,348 were disappeared during the military dictatorship.",

She won two Grand Slam Doubles Titles and was a quarter finalist in singles at the U.S. Open and The French Open. Her father Jerry, a well known coach, helped Margaret Court win the coveted Grand Slam (all four Grand Slam titles in one year) in 1970 and Virginia Wade to her 1977 Wimbledon triumph. Teeguarden was voted the \"Most Watchable Player\" based on play and appearance by a group of Madison Avenue advertising executives or \"Mad Men\" while playing at the US Open. Teeguarden played in 19 consecutive US Opens, holding the record until Chris Evert played in 20. She wore the first all black outfit in the history of tennis in 1975 at The Bridgestone Doubles Championships in Tokyo, starting a trend that is still popular today. Teeguarden was the first woman tennis player signed by Nike.

Well-known species are members of the type genus \"Scolytus\", namely the European elm bark beetle \"S. multistriatus\" and the large elm bark beetle \"S. scolytus\", which like the American elm bark beetle \"Hylurgopinus rufipes\", transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (\"Ophiostoma\"). The mountain pine beetle \"Dendroctonus ponderosae\", southern pine beetle \"Dendroctonus frontalis\", and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America.

The species is regarded as the smallest free-living insect, as well as the smallest beetle. They are among featherwing beetle, named because of their feather-like spiny wings. It was first discovered in Nicaragua, and described in 1999 by Wesley Eugene Hall of the University of Nebraska State Museum. The initial discovery consisted of very few specimens, and exact measurements were not conclusive. Because of their tiny size, they were difficult to observe under microscope after preservation. The generally accepted size was 0.300\u00a0mm in length. On 8 February 2015, Alexey Polilov of the Lomonosov Moscow State University collected 85 specimens in Chicaque National Park, Colombia. They were discovered on a layer of fungus on which they feed. From these specimens exact measurements could be made, and was found that the smallest individual is only 0.325\u00a0mm long. The largest individual is 0.352\u00a0mm long, and the average length of all the specimens is 0.338\u00a0mm.

After releasing two demos - \"Malfeitor\" (in 1991) and \"Pandemonium\" (in 1992), they changed their name to \"Battle\" and there were some line up changes at the time. In the year of 1992 the band released the \"End of Life\" demo. The demo contains only one song which is around 11 minutes. The line up at the time of recording the demo was: Storm - on bass and vocals, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m - on guitars and Jardar - on drums. The guitars were written by Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m (1974 - 2014). In 1993 the band changed the name to \"Strid\" which means \"Battle\" in Norwegian. That same year, Strid re-released their \"End of Life\" demo under their new name, through the German label \"Malicious Records\". After releasing the \"End of life\" demo, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m left the band and was replaced by Ravn Harjar. Through the years between 1993 and 1995, the band writes and records the self-titled EP which was released through Malicious Records and contains only two songs - \"Det hviskes blant sorte vinder\" which means \"It Is Whispered Amid the Black Winds\" in Norwegian and \"Nattevandring\" which means \"Nightwandering\" in Norwegian. The music style and sound of this demo is more ambient/atmospheric black metal oriented. Mainly because of this release, the band is commonly recognised as the creators of depressive black metal along with some other bands from the second wave of black metal music. At this time the band line up contains: Ravn Harjar - on guitars, Storm - on bass and vocals and Jardar - on drums. After the releasing of the self-titled EP, there was no any official releases by the band. There are also bootleg releases that came out through the years like the CD from 2005 by Ars Mysteriorum and LP, each featuring both \"End of Life\" and the self - titled EP tracks. In the year of 2001 the original former member of \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\", bass player and vocalist - Storm committed suicide. In the year of 2007, the Greek label Kyrck Productions & Armour re-released all the previous material released by the band from the past which contains all \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\" material. Somewhere between 2009 and 2010 there was a reunion of the band with old members including Vicotnik (D\u00f8dheimsgard, ex-Aphrodisiac, ex-Ved Buens Ende, ex-Manes, ex-Code, ex-Naer Mataron, ex-Endwarfment). Another member that was part of the reunion was Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m - the main composer of the \"End of Life\" track. In 2014 Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m died. At this time the band line up contains Ravn Harjar - on guitars and vocals, Vicotnik - on bass and Sigmund (ex-Inflabitan, ex-D\u00f8dheimsgard) - on guitars. In January 2015, Ravn Harjar wrote a statement on the official Strid Facebook page that in the autumn of the year 2015 the band will start recording their first full-length album which will be titled \"Endetid\". That means \"End of times\" in Norwegian.",

The term \"art game\" was first used academically in 2002 and it has come to be understood as describing a video game designed to emphasize art or whose structure is intended to produce some kind of reaction in its audience. Art games are \"interactive\" (usually \"competitive\" against the computer, self, or other players) and the result of \"artistic intent\" by the party offering the piece for consideration. They also typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"video game art\".",

At the request of a friend in 1993, he composed the music for the video game \"Voyeur\", but after creating the music for two more games he left the industry, citing the low budgets and poor quality of video game music at the time. He continued to compose for film and television, only to return to video games for 2005's \"Destroy All Humans!\". Finding that in his absence the quality and perceived importance of video game music had risen substantially, he has since composed for several games, writing the scores to \"BioShock\" and \"Dante's Inferno\" among others. He still composes for film however, his latest being \"Brush with Danger\" directed by young \"Indonesian\" director \"Livi Zheng\".

Video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills. As the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile, the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate - some studios emphasising the auteur model while others emphasising a more team oriented model.

Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008. In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. S\u00fcdhof; they were recognised \"after discovering how cells precisely transport material\".

His career peaked in 1960\u201361 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. His performances on the 1961 tour of England saw him named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Thereafter his form was less formidable, characterised by nervousness and fidgeting at the start of his innings. Persistent knee problems as well as a controversial media attack on the legality of West Indian bowler Charlie Griffith saw him dropped from the Australian team after 1965. O'Neill also bowled occasional leg spin and was regarded as one of the finest fielders of his era. He later became a cricket commentator and his son Mark O'Neill also played cricket at state level.",

Messer, who was married to Pinkney's cousin, Lucy. In the 1930s, the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club, which constructed the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club Cabin nearby, leased the barn from the National Park Service.

Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows. Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.",

SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum.\" SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called \"NIM1\", \"NPR1\" or \"SAI1\" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system \"Arabidopsis thaliana\". SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species. SAR can be activated in corn, however, widely adapted commercial like Benzothiadiazole may not be efficient against \"P. sorghi\" causing common rust.",

He attended the Ohio State University where he played college football at the guard position for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1956 to 1957. He was selected by the All-America Board, the American Football Coaches Association, the Associated Press, and the Football Writers Association of America as a first-team guard on their respective 1957 College Football All-America Team. He averaged 57 minute a game during the 1957 season, and Ohio State coach Woody Hayes said, \"For consistent play on both offense and defense, there is no better guard in college football today.\" Thomas was drafted in 1958 by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he was released by the Steelers in late August 1958 before the start of the regular season. After graduating from Ohio State, Thomas worked as a teacher for several years, worked for New York Life Insurance Company and later started his own insurance brokerage business in Columbus, Ohio. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.",

The film documents the extent to which these achievements, as Loach sees them, have since been subject to attack in the decades that followed, particularly under the Conservative governments of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

The band was on the now-defunct label Takehold Records before joining Century Media. A few albums were re-released through Tooth & Nail. Before breaking up the band were featured on The Vans Warped tour and were getting ready to hit Europe for their international release of \"Crave and Collapse\", which was received well over seas. The band has been considered highly influential for their progressive and inventive style of hardcore and rock. When the band broke up in 2003, John LaRussa went on to form Inhale Exhale with Brian Pittman, a former member of Relient K. John Pope joined Symphony In Peril briefly in 2003, and six months after he joined they disbanded. There has been rumors of a reunion that's surfaced from time to time, but nothing official. Mostly due to John LaRussa's busy schedule at times and refusal to play with the band again.

However, the team communicated with the federation and regularly communicated the progress of the project to build a relationship in preparation for being sanctioned in the future. In May 2014, it was announced that the team had officially become associated with the QSF and were working together to perhaps eventually become a member of CONCACAF and play against other national teams.

Usually in Qu\u00e9bec, the majority of the population speak French, while English is the largest minority. Although the purpose of the team is said to be cultural, not political, the team is partially funded by the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society and Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a Canadian political party that advocates the Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty movement. The team was formed in 2013 and played its first match against a Tibet select team in the 2013 International Peoples, Cultures, and Tribes Tournament, an event hosted by Marseille as the 2013 European Capital of Culture, on 24 June 2013.

        "text": "Tales of Heich\u016b (Heich\u016b monogatari) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries. As early as the \"Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\" (\"Many\u014dsh\u016b\"), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations. The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time. People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion. Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's composition. The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the \"Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry\" (Kokinsh\u016b), the first imperial poetry collection, which was completed around 905. By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold, and \"Tales of Ise\" (Ise monogatari), \"Tales of Heich\u016b\", and \"Tales of Yamato\" (Yamato monogatari) seem to have emerged at about this same time. Also, the second imperial poetry collection, \"Collection of Later Poetry\" (Gosensh\u016b), commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter, has many narrative qualities. The only extant manuscript of \"Tales of Heich\u016b\" is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period (1185\u20131333), some three hundred years after the work's probable date of composition.",

These organisms do not remain as plankton permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms. After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor. Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans and dinoflagellates and diatoms. Meroplankton forms an algal medium that is found between the loosely mixed sediments and water. This layer can be re-suspended in the water column by turbulent mixing. Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement. Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses. Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species. Many of the common, well-known animals found on the Great Barrier Reef spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become. The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults. Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year. However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate.",

He is best known as the father of Ulysses S. Grant and the one who introduced Ulysses to military life at West Point. Jesse was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania and was one of seven children. He was a self made man who rose from poverty to become a somewhat wealthy merchant. At age five, Jesse's family moved to Ohio and settled in the . Unable to support all his children Jesse's father arranged for his apprenticeship at farms and tanneries during his youth. Jesse married Hannah Simpson and they became the parents of three boys and three girls, with Ulysses being their oldest. Raised in a poor family that was forced to split up and having to work at an early age, Jesse persistently encouraged his sons in the ways of education, industry and hard work, his methods sometimes testing his father-son relationship with Ulysses. As a young man he worked for and came to know Owen Brown and soon acquired strong abolitionist sympathies. Originally a Jacksonian, Jesse eventually broke with the Democrats as he developed anti-slavery leanings, and for a time wrote a number of controversial editorials in support of abolition and about other issues, including Ulysses at Shiloh. He became involved in local politics and was elected Mayor in Georgetown and later, Bethel, both in Ohio. During the American Civil War Jesse and his two partners became involved in cotton speculation and personally prevailed upon his son Ulysses, now a Commanding General, requesting permits to deal in cotton in Grant's district, causing serious complications. Soon after the war Jesse stood next to his son Ulysses while he was sworn in as President, thereafter becoming a frequent visitor to the White House, while living out his final years in Covington, Kentucky. Much has been learned about the earlier years of his son Ulysses from letters between the two and other material relating to Jesse's background and business.",

Anderson commissioned the building, which was completed in 1928 and owned by Anderson's family for the first 27 years of its existence. The building was designed by Godfrey E. Larson, a Chicago architect who later worked as a field representative for the Public Works Administration. The apartment was built in the Spanish Baroque Revival style, which can be seen in the pilasters and swan's-neck pediment in its entryway and the two windows designed to resemble balconies. While many six-flat apartments were constructed in West Ridge and neighboring Rogers Park in the 1920s, the Anderson-Carlson Building is the only one designed in the Spanish Baroque Revival style and one of the few with a highly detailed design. The building has been largely unaltered since its construction; with the exception of one window, every major feature of the building is still present, and five of its six apartments have maintained their original design. On November 15, 2003, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.",

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Because of industrial growth the city's population doubled between 1890 and 1900, and then again between 1900 and 1910. The housing development named the Highlands was developed during this period of economic growth. John Steely, a real estate broker, and Lewis Lichty, an attorney who owned the Waterloo Canning Company, bought the property known as sandhill in 1901, and opened an office for the Highland Land Company in the Century Building in 1905. The historic district is all residential buildings. The oldest house predates the development having been built in 1900. Otherwise construction began in the center of the district in 1908 and moved outward. By 1942 all but 15 houses were built. They are all frame construction with exteriors composed of wood, stucco, brick and stone. Styles popular in the district include Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival and American Craftsman. Waterloo architect Mortimer B. Cleveland is responsible for designing at least 39 of the houses here. Chicago landscape architect Howard Evarts Weed designed the Square and boulevard plantings. This was Waterloo's first suburban residential development. It became the enclave for the city's industrial and professional elite in the first half of the 20th century.",

Twist-necked turtles have extremely flat shells that help them hide from predators under rocks and debris. When threatened, this turtle withdraws by twisting its head into its shell. \"P. platycephala\" is the only species of the genus \"Platemys\" and occurs in northern and central South America. \"Platemys platycephala\" means \u201cflat turtle, flat-head\u201d and accurately describes the structure of the head and shell. This species inhabits shallow creek beds and frequently forages on the floor of the Amazon rainforest for insects, amphibians, and mollusks. Camouflage, head and body shape, and advanced sexual anatomy allow this species of turtle to effectively populate much of South America. Mating occurs during rainy months (March\u2013December) and egg deposit occurs during dry months (January\u2013March). Males have been known to behave aggressively towards females during copulation by squirting water from nostrils and biting. A few genomic studies show mosaicism exists among populations of the twist-necked turtle in Surinam. In other words, diploid and triploid levels exist among individuals at this particular location. No threats have been reported for this species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature does not have a current listing.

The marsupials and xenarthrans are 'old-timers', their ancestors having been present on the continent since at least the very early Cenozoic Era. During the early Cenozoic, South America's only land connection was to Antarctica, so it was effectively cut off from most of the world; as the fragments of Gondwana continued to separate, this connection was lost, leaving South America an island continent. Caviomorph rodents and monkeys arrived as 'waif dispersers' by rafting across the Atlantic from Africa in the Eocene epoch, 35 million or more years ago. All the remaining nonflying mammals of South America are recent arrivals, having migrated from North America via Central America during the past seven million years as part of the Great American Interchange; this invasion, which peaked around three million years ago, was made possible when the formation of the volcanic Isthmus of Panama bridged North and South America. The newcomers out-competed and drove to extinction many unique mammals that had evolved during South America's long period of isolation, as well as some species from other classes (e.g., terror birds).",

Based on IUCN data, Mexico has 23% more noncetacean mammal species than the U.S. and Canada combined in an area only 10% as large, or a species density over 12 times that of its northern neighbors. Mexico's high mammal biodiversity is in part a reflection of the wide array of biomes present over its latitudinal, climatic and altitudinal ranges, from lowland tropical rainforest to temperate desert to montane forest to alpine tundra. The general increase in terrestrial biodiversity moving towards the equator is another important factor in the comparison. Mexico includes much of the Mesoamerican and Madrean pine-oak woodlands biodiversity hotspots. From a biogeographic standpoint, most of Mexico is linked to the rest of North America as part of the Nearctic ecozone. However, the lowlands of southern Mexico are linked with Central America and South America as part of the Neotropic ecozone. Extensive mixing of Nearctic and Neotropical mammal species commenced only three million years ago, when the formation of the Isthmus of Panama ended South America's long period of isolation and precipitated the Great American Interchange. Twenty of Mexico's extant nonflying species (opossums, armadillos, anteaters, monkeys and caviomorph rodents) are of South American origin. Most of the megafauna that formerly inhabited the region became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene about 10,000 years ago, shortly after the arrival of the first humans. Increasing alteration and destruction of natural habitats by expanding human populations during the last several centuries is causing further attrition of the region's biodiversity, as exemplified by the 'hotspot' designations (by definition, such areas have lost over 70% of their primary vegetation).",

The following year, he made his film debut starring alongside John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson in the war film \"Empire of the Sun\". Bale's role of a young boy, interned in China by the Japanese, received praise from most film critics. Two years later, Bale had a minor role in \"Henry V\", a drama film based on William Shakespeare's play \"The Life of Henry the Fifth\". It has been considered one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made. In 1992, Bale starred as Jack Kelly in the Walt Disney musical drama \"Newsies\", which was a critical and commercial failure; however, it gained a cult following. He received a role in the 1994 drama \"Little Women\", which garnered positive reviews. Bale lent his voice for the Disney animated film \"Pocahontas\" in 1995, although it received a mixed reception and attained box office success. He starred as British journalist Arthur Stuart in the Todd Haynes-directed drama \"Velvet Goldmine\" (1998). Although critics were divided on the film, Bale's role was \"eagerly anticipated\". Bale portrayed Demetrius in the critically praised 1999 film \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", an adaptation of Shakespeare's play of the same name, directed by Michael Hoffman.

He was also, almost by accident, an advertising and radio pioneer who began the era of Mexican border blaster radio. Although he was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Kansas and several other states, Brinkley, a demagogue beloved by hundreds of thousands of people in Kansas and elsewhere, nevertheless launched two campaigns for Kansas governor, one of which was nearly successful.

He states that they were sitting around, complaining about being heroin addicts, when they started improvising lyrics and music (\"Brownstone\" is a slang term for heroin). The lyrics make a clear reference to the tolerance that the drug causes in the verse that says:\"\"I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do, so the little got more and more. I just keep trying to get a little better, said a little better than before\"\". When they had the lyrics all together, with some help from Dezi, they wrote it down on the back of a grocery bag and brought it to Axl Rose.

In the offseason, Barry Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative free agent contract worth a then-record $43.75 million over 6 years with the Giants, with whom his father spent the first 7 years of his career, and with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary. To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the Giants, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco. (His number during most of his stay with the Pirates, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway). Bonds hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route to his second consecutive MVP award, and third overall (of an eventual seven). As good as the Giants were (winning 103 games), the Atlanta Braves won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (due to the Wild Card being instituted the following season). After going up by nine games August 11 with a 77-38 record, the Giants went 12-18 and found themselves three-and-a-half games behind, a 12.5-game swing, by September 15. They then went on a 14-2 run, which left them one game behind the Braves with one game remaining, which they lost 12-1 to become the only National League team to win 100 or more games (103) and not make the playoffs in the divisional play era.",

The coalition is made up of approximately 40 Islamist parties and groups. The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call \"corrupt\" from the Mubarak regime. Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013. The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president. The group has reached out to what it called \"fellow revolutionaries\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation. Members of the Building and Development Party, the political arm of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, wanted to meet with Yasser Al Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call as well as Emad Abdel Ghaffour, who is the head of the Homeland Party. Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the Shura Council that was dissolved. Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions. The alliance has said it will boycott the 2014 constitutional referendum. Various groups and parties within the alliance including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the Nour Party for its support of the draft constitution. The Islamic Party has not participated in meetings with the group because of what Mohamed Abu Samra (the secretary-general of the party) called the \"brotherhood's radical thought\".

Individuals or companies were allowed from the beginning of the demarcation process until 90 days after FUNAI issued their report to submit an appeal showing that the contested lands do not meet the qualifications of indigenous lands as stated in the constitution. The decree also placed the final decision in the hands of the Minister of Justice, which left the fate of indigenous lands vulnerable to various political ideologies. The government claimed that allowing people to contest indigenous lands during the demarcation process would prevent any future challenges of completed lands on the basis of unconstitutionality. The decree was widely contested as a violation of indigenous rights, earning the nickname of the \"Genocide Decree,\" due to the power it gave to commercial interests to exploit Indian lands. By April 1996, FUNAI had received over 500 appeals for over 40 indigenous territories that were in the process of being demarcated. FUNAI followed procedure and submitted its official opinion to the Ministry of Justice, rejecting the appeals that were brought against the indigenous lands.

Since 2016 he focused on English speaking markets [\"Tyrant\" TV series season 3 (2016), American FX TV Network, \"Vikings\" season 5 (2017), History Channel and \"The Last Post\" TV mini series, UK's BBC TV]. His roles covered a multitude of genres, from musicals [\"None but that!\" (2007)], action [\"Agamista\"(2007), \"Eyes Of A Thief\" (2014)], thrillers [\"Kashf Hesab\" (2007)], art-house [\"Heliopolis\" (2009), \"Villa 69\" (2013), \"Decor\" (2014)] and a slapstick comedy [\"Habibi Naeman (Sleeping Habibi)\" (2008)]. He played the lead in many award-winning films that gained him outstanding international critics acclaim as one of the finest actors in the world today out of the Arab region. He studied and graduated (with highest honours) as a Tele-communication engineer' from Ain Shams University, studied theatre (as a minor) at the American University in Cairo, and worked on a spacecraft design program (UoSAT-5 ) in the UK. He finally confirmed his passion and calling for the arts by the year 2000. In a film festival in 2016 celebrating Arabic films submissions to the \"Oscars,\" he was honoured for being the most submitted actor in Arabic films submissions to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"The Oscars)\". He is often tagged in western media as \"Egypt's \"Brad Pitt\" for his many career similarities with the latter, also described as \"the next Omar Sharif\" specially after his American debut movie \"Civic Duty\" in 2007. He was also described as \"Egypt's International treasure\" for advocating for freedom and standing up against injustice in his home country Egypt.

The plant is called skunk cabbage because of the distinctive \"skunky\" odor that it emits when it blooms. This odor will permeate the area where the plant grows, and can be detected even in old, dried specimens. The distinctive odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies and beetles.

The club was incorporated in 1940. The arena was the venue for ice shows throughout the 1940s. It hosted the Pacific Coast Hockey League's San Diego Skyhawks from 1944 to 1950. The arena held 5,000 people. The Skyhawks won the Pacific Coast Hockey League Championship for the 1948-1949 season. Glacier Gardens was located at the intersection of 8th and Harbor, just south of present day Petco Park. By 1956, the venue was known as just \"The Arena.\" Elvis Presley, with his backup band, guitarist Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black, and drummer D. J. Fontana, appeared at the arena on April 4 and 5, 1956 and June 5 and 6, 1956. In the early 1960s, the arena was sub-leased for retail and auctions, then for manufacture of a miniature jeep, the Crofton Bug. The Arena was torn down a few years later. The San Diego Sports Arena, which in 2010 became the Valley View Casino Center, has served as a venue for minor league ice hockey and other indoor sports in San Diego since 1966.",

Historically, the lake was spring-fed, and sat on the property of William Neil in North Columbus (then a city of its own, which would later be annexed by Columbus). The trustees in charge of purchasing land for the new Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (which would later become the Ohio State University) chose to purchase Mr. Neil's land after drinking from the spring. A German trustee reportedly stated \"It's hard to get a Dutchman away from a spring like that.\" The spring dried up in 1891 when the city of Columbus struck the source of the spring while installing a trunk sewer line through campus. The water source was subsequently provided by the city of Columbus municipal water supply, at a new location on campus near the location of the original lake. Visitors, students, faculty, and staff enjoy the fountains that run in spring, summer, and autumn.",

He was a \"chotara\" i.e. a person of mixed races. His band's name speaks volumes on the influence of Cuban music in the 40s and 50s in East Africa. He played guitar and mandolin. The main themes of his music were, the joy and pain of love, life wisdom, the good and evil of man kind and even politics. For about twenty years, until Abdullah's sudden death in a car accident in 1965, Cuban Marimba was one of the most popular muziki wa dansi (dance music) bands in Tanzania. One of his popular tunes is Mkono wa Idd, which is usually played in the radio during Idd festivities. Just before his death, he released a twist tune, a departure from his suave rumba style,\" Hapo zamani sana\" about the horrible colonial days in South Africa. Then in another, he paid tribute to Tanzanian women, \"Wanawake wa Tanzania wazuri sana.\" Abdullah was replaced by Juma Kilaza, but the band declined.",

The indicator is used in photosynthesis and respiration experiments to find out whether carbon dioxide is being liberated. It is also used to test the carbon dioxide content during gaseous exchange of organisms. When the carbon dioxide content is higher than 0.04%, the initial red color changes to yellow as the pH becomes more acidic. If the carbon dioxide content is lower than 0.04%, it changes from red to magenta and, in relatively very low carbon dioxide concentrations, to purple. Carbon dioxide, even in the concentrations found in exhaled air, will dissolve in the indicator to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which will lower the pH and give the characteristic colour change. A colour change to purple during photosynthesis shows a reduction in the percentage of carbon dioxide and is sometimes inferred as production of oxygen, but there is not actually any direct evidence for it.",

Anoxygenic photosynthesis is the phototrophic process where light energy is captured and stored as ATP. The production of oxygen is non-existent and, therefore, water is not used as an electron donor. They are widely distributed marine plankton that may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community. They can be particularly abundant in oligotrophic conditions where they were found to be 24% of the community. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are photoheterotrophic (phototroph)microbes that exist in a variety of aquatic environments. Photoheterotrophs(Gk: photo = light, hetero = (an)other, troph = nourishment), are heterotrophic organisms that use light to produce energy, but are unable to utilize carbon dioxide as their primary carbon source. Most are obligately aerobic, meaning they require oxygen to grow. One remarkable aspect of these novel bacteria is that they, unlike other similar bacteria, are unable to utilize BChl (bacteriochlorophyll) for anaerobic growth.The only photosynthetic pigment that exists in AAPB is BChl a. Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria, on the contrary, can contain numerous species of photosynthetic pigments like bacteriochlorophyll a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. There is still a large void in the areas regarding the abundance and genetic diversity of the AAPB, as well as the environmental variables that regulate these properties.",

In musical compositions, such as songs and pieces, these are the lowest parts of the harmony. In choral music without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male bass singers. In an orchestra, the bass lines are played by the double bass and cellos, bassoon or contrabassoon, low brass such as the tuba and bass trombone, and the timpani (kettledrums). In many styles of traditional music such as Bluegrass, folk, and in styles such as Rockabilly and Big Band and Bebop jazz, the bass role is filled by the upright bass. In most rock and pop bands and in jazz fusion groups, the bass role is filled by the electric bass. In some 20th and 21st century pop genres, such as 1980s pop, hip hop music and Electronic Dance Music, the bass role may be filled with a bass synthesizer.",

Recorded in Hollywood, the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet, although it resulted in drummer Dave Lombardo meeting Gene Hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed. It was during the recording of this session that Lombardo first had the double bass added to his kit. Hoglan, working for Slayer at the time, sat at the kit and played a double bass for the first time. Lombardo was impressed and although Hoglan never gave him lessons, he did give him tips regarding the use of the double kick drum.",

This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure. (By comparison, main sequence stars resist collapse through thermal pressure.) The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit would be subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole.

        "text": "Al-Ca composite is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite consisting of sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix. The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor. It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed. Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission. Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type. This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors. This eliminates the \"bird caging\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands. The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys. The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines. Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs. The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations. The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.",

It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33\u2153-rpm album. The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world. The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish. The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale. From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations. Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released. This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution. Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas. \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953. In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album. For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released. That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's. M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1. For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play. So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled. In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release. Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller. Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order. Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\" That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Sagle. This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases.",

For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus \"error\" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables. Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research and finance. Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables. It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality.",

It does not appear to have been a regulatory body in the usual manner of a masonic Grand Lodge, and as such is seen as a \"Mother Lodge\" like Kilwinning in Scotland. It met to create Freemasons, and as such enabled the foundation of new lodges. For much of its career, it was the only lodge in its own jurisdiction, but even with dependent lodges it continued to function mainly as an ordinary lodge of Freemasons. Having existed since at least 1705 as the \"Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York\", it was in 1725, possibly in response to the expansion of the new Grand Lodge in London, that they styled themselves the \"Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York\". Activity ground to a halt some time in the 1730s, but was revived with renewed vigour in 1761. It was during this second period of activity that part of the Lodge of Antiquity, having quit the Grand Lodge of England in London, allied themselves with their Northern brethren and became, between 1779 and 1789, the \"Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent\". Shortly after Antiquity's re-absorption into the London Grand Lodge she had founded, the Grand Lodge at York ceased to function again, this time for good.",

The Party, which had its roots in various earlier political movements, came together in the period immediately prior to the 1911 state election under the guidance of Sir John Forrest, the Federal member for Swan and former Premier of Western Australia, and other leading political figures in the State. It was assembled in response to the solid organisation of the Labor Party and had the aim of assisting Ministerial members in winning seats and retaining power in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The Party did not involve itself in Federal politics, although many of its members were also associated with the Commonwealth Liberal Party and assisted Liberal candidates and members from Western Australia in that capacity. The massive defeat of the Ministerial faction by Labor in that election resulted in what remained of the faction formally joining the Liberal Party, which became the first organised non-Labor movement in the State and was a precursor to the Nationalist Party and, later, the modern Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division).",

The series consists of six main episodes, a \"lost\" episode, and a final game; all but the final game were originally released for MS-DOS in 1990 and 1991, while the 2001 \"Commander Keen\" was released for the Game Boy Color. The series follows the titular Commander Keen, the secret identity of the eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, as he defends the Earth and the galaxy from alien threats with his homemade spaceship, rayguns, and pogo stick. The first three episodes were developed by Ideas from the Deep, the precursor to id, and published by Apogee Software as the shareware title \"Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons\"; the \"lost\" episode 3.5 \"Commander Keen in Keen Dreams\" was developed by id and published as a retail title by Softdisk; episodes four and five were released by Apogee as the shareware \"Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy\"; and the simultaneously developed episode six was published in retail by FormGen as \"Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter\".

It was the only story that Mann was ever commissioned to write, and he finished it in just eight weeks, beginning on January 18, 1943, and ending on March 13, 1943. Publisher Armin L. Robinson, believing the Ten Commandments to be the basis on which civilization was founded, wanted to make a movie detailing the Nazi's \"desecration of the Mosaic Decalogue.\" Instead, he settled on a book, entitled \"The Ten Commandments: Ten Short Novels of Hitler's War Against the Moral Code,\" with ten authors, one for each commandment. Mann's novella, which he was paid $1000 to write, was originally meant to be the introduction to the volume, but Robinson liked it so much that he decided to make it the first story, under the heading \"Thou Shalt Have No Other God Before Me.\" It should also be noted that Mann considered his story to be greatly superior to that of his fellow contributors, and he considered the overall book a \"failure\".",

Paul Nguyen was born in Vietnam and immigrated to France, where he attended the University in Nice. Here he met a fellow student, Jadwiga Alfabet, a Jewish refugee from Poland and became engaged. In the summer of 1942 French police began arresting Jews with foreign nationality, including some of Jadwiga's relatives. Paul married Jadwiga on 5 September 1942, in the hope that gaining French citizenship she'd be protected from deportation. The couple then moved to Clermont-Ferrand, returning to Nice in 1943 when that city was in Italian control and relatively safe. However, in September 1943 the Germans re-occupied Nice and danger of deportation returned. From this time Paul Nguyen hid his wife, her uncle and aunt, Jakub and Salome Berliner and their baby son Roland. Obtaining false papers in November 1943 he arranged a people smuggler to take Jakub to Switzerland. He arranged a second journey with Salome Berliner and her infant. Paul and Jadwiga Nguyen had two daughters. Yad Vashem recognized Paul as Righteous on 30 April 2007. Paul Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Anh is the only Vietnamese person so recognized.

The lyrics speak of a disagreement between lovers, but concludes with the line \"all you have to do to make it right is just touch your woman\". A tranquil, slow-tempo ballad, the song differed from many of Parton's other hits at the time, in that it was neither an upbeat, lilting country number, nor a nostalgic reminiscence of her rural childhood. \"Touch Your Woman\" reached number 6 on the U.S. country singles charts in March 1972, though a number of country radio stations refused to play it because they found it too sexually suggestive.",

According to Zvyagintsev, the story of Marvin Heemeyer in the United States inspired him and it was adapted into a Russian setting, but critics compare the story to the more similar biblical story of Naboth's Vineyard, where a King vies for his subjects' land and is motivated by his Queen to obtain it in a sly manner. The character development of the protagonist parallels another biblical figure, Job. The producer Alexander Rodnyansky has said: \"It deals with some of the most important social issues of contemporary Russia while never becoming an artist's sermon or a public statement; it is a story of love and tragedy experienced by ordinary people\". Critics noted the film as being formidable, dealing with quirks of fate, power and money.",

The initial albums garnered rave reviews from Rolling Stone and several of the independent music journals of the time. Black Sun Ensemble opened for Camper Van Beethoven on the \"Key Lime Pie\" tour in 1989 to appreciative audiences across North America. Infamous circumstances surrounding their Geffen Records showcase in Los Angeles lead to the quiet intervention of Paul McCartney to get certain members and their entourage out of custody- a tarot card was involved, but any more may detail may arouse the attorneys! (based on statements from Jesus Acedo & Duane Norman). Additionally, the bloody death of a goat in the audience at the 1994 Burning Man festival lead to widespread public outcry and condemnation from animal rights group PETA. The band was forced underground and splintered, reformed and fell into hiatus due to extenuating circumstances and the mental illness of Jesus Acedo. Mickey Rourke, a close friend to Jesus Acedo at the time, was urged by friends and family to visit Acedo in his dreams embodying the dark angel, compelling him to resume writing. This was the inspiration for the song, \"Murder\" (showcased on the October 29, 2015 episode of Shonda Rimes' ABC hit show How to Get Away with Murder).

After the release of the Custom Floor record, Swank's other project, Foundation Skateboards, gained some financial momentum, and Goldenrod was put on hold. Swank's friend Mark Waters, an employee at Lou's Records at the time, and also a photographer and writer in the skateboarding world, was looking to start a record label and asked Swank for advice. A partnership was born and the \"no rules for records\" idea was spawned. Basically, this meant that if they liked a band, they'd put out a record if they could, without worrying about how many would sell. A long series of releases by primarily San Diego bands followed, and several noteworthy San Diego bands made their debut on Goldenrod Records: No Knife, Heavy Vegetable, Boilermaker, 100 Watt Halo, The Crimson Curse, etc. Other notable bands who released records on Goldenrod include Three Mile Pilot, fluf, Supernova, Tina, Age 13, Big Drill Car, Hemlock, Lucy's Fur Coat, Fishwife, Deadbolt.

He was among those who were disillusioned with the progress of Congress party on socialism and formed a new party, Socialist Party in 1948. He however left that party along with Aruna Asaf Ali and they visited Moscow along with Rajani Palme Dutt. Both of them joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) before Joseph Stalin's death but left the party in 1956 following Nikita Khrushchev's disowning of Stalin. Edatata Narayanan started a daily newspaper, \"Patriot\"(1963)\u00b0 as the Chief Editor and was also associated with a weekly, \"Link\" in 1958 along with Aruna Asaf Ali. The publications became prestigious due to patronage of leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon and Biju Patnaik. When Edatata Narayanan wanted to make some editorial changes amidst reported opposition from the editorial staff, he told them in no uncertain terms that he belonged to the school of journalism where the editor's view is final. He brought \"Patriot\" into the spotlight by publishing the income tax returns of top industrialists in it and thus, bringing the information into public domain. He pursued a pro-CPI and pro-Left editorial policy - Indira Gandhi, a good friend and later the Prime Minister of India herself was pro-left. The publications and the associated publishing house were successful.

He was amongst the first to respond to the call of Pakistan sounded by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 (Qutote from Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Prime Minister of Pakistan), Dr. Khursheed kamal aziz Pakistan's official historian) has described this book as \"the most comprehensive and far reaching scheme aimed at furthering and elaborating the idea of Pakistan. Waheed uz-Zaman wrote in his book, \"Pakistan\", Lahore, 1964, P. 168, \"The book was taken into consideration by the Muslim league, while preparing the Lahore resolution and the fact the solution proposed in the confederacy of India\" differed but little from the proposed by the Muslim League in March 1940. The venear of a Confederacy, which was the main theme of his scheme, could anytime be set aside and the remainder would have precisely... Pakistan. So scholarly and so cogent was his reasoning that men like Dr.Rajendra Prasad felt compelled to join issues with him in his books, (\"Pakistan\"(Bombay and Calcutta, September 1940), p 34; see also his book \"\"India Divided\"\" page 180-181). The book was reviewed in leading newspapers and journals. Comparatively more scholarly appraisal was in the \"Tarjaman-ul-Quran\" of Maulana Abul Ala Maududi. According to Mian Kifait Ali \"The idea was suggested to me by the late Choudhary Rahmat Ali's writings and I developmed it to an extent to which no one had done earlier (Letter to Dr. K.K, September 5, 1968)\". Ali also stated that originally it was proposed to publish the book under the title of \"Pakistan\" a typed manuscript which bore this page title was sent to the press. Soon after he received a telegraphic message from the Muhammad Ali Jinnah that book should not appear under the pen name of \"Pakistan\". It was to comply with the Quaid's directive he prepared a federal scheme and was incorporated in the introduction of the book. Thus the book was titled as \"Confederacy of India\". (Nation article, 23 December 1994 by Sarfraz Hussain Mirza, \"\"Confederacy of India by A Punjabi\"\", also in Daily Times, Cam Diary, \"\"Pak history in Leichester\"\", and article by V.P Bhatia \"\"'Jinnah was against the name 'Pakistan' at First\"\". It was in recognition of this work of Mian Kifait Ali that he was invited to work on the committee presided over by Sir Abdullah Haroon set up in February 1940 to examine the various schemes of constitutional reforms for India and to see whether a consolidated scheme can finally be framed. His book has been referred to as the most comprehensive schemes at demystifying and detailing the ideas regarding the inception of Pakistan, quite a lot has been written about him and his work. Mian Kifait Ali has done \"pioneering work in the evolution of Muslim political thoughts and has suffered the hardship of a pioneer\u2026 when an objective appraisal of Muslim political movement is made by the historian. He will find an honourable place among the pioneers and selfless workers in this great field of Muslim reconstruction (Quoted by Governor Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani). Famous independence-era personalities such as Abul Ala Maududi, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon, and Sardar V. Patel took issue with him.

It was recorded on different locations which included Jamaica and France. \"18 til I Die\" featured the number one song \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\", which had been released as a single and on the soundtrack to the film Don Juan DeMarco over a year prior, and 4 other singles: \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\" (the album's second single, released May 28), \"Let's Make a Night to Remember\", \"Star\", and \"18 til I Die\"; the album track \"I'll Always Be Right There\" was also released to radio in the United States. After the release of the album in June, to promote the album, Adams toured around North America and Europe. Perhaps the most memorable of these concerts was playing to more than 70,000 people at Wembley Stadium (1923) in July 1996. The album has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.",

It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824. The symphony is one of the best-known works in common practice music. It is widely viewed by critics as one of Beethoven's greatest works, the pinnacle of musical Classicism, and one of the greatest compositions in the western musical canon. The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony (thus making it a choral symphony). The words are sung during the final movement by four vocal soloists and a chorus. They were taken from the \"Ode to Joy\", a poem written by Friedrich Schiller in 1785 and revised in 1803, with text additions made by the composer. In the 2010s, it stands as one of the most performed symphonies in the world.",

They do not make specific mention of Christmas but the importance they attach to looking forward to the birth of one particular child somewhere, anywhere, suggests a reference to the birth of Jesus Christ, and the citing of \"a tiny star\" that \"lights up way up high\" may allude to the Star of Bethlehem.

The simple lyrics consist of the phrase \"\"Lloyd George knew my father/Father knew Lloyd George\"\" sung to the tune \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\". In the schoolboy song, the two lines referring to Lloyd George are repeated incessantly, typically by groups of schoolboys on a bus or similar setting, until boredom sets in. There are no lyrics other than those two lines. The song gains much of its notoriety from the irony inevitable in the clash between the song's flippant lyrics and Sabine Baring-Gould's classic hymn from which Arthur Sullivan's tune is inextricable. It is also commonly sung to the tune of \"Land of Hope and Glory\".",

Born in Traverse City, Michigan, he showed musical talent at an early age and studied music at the University of Michigan. Sawyer conducted the University's Women's Glee Club and led the Bill Sawyer Orchestra, a big band that was featured on WMAQ's \"Fitch Summer Bandwagon\" on July 7, 1940. He composed several arrangements of choral works; popular songs for Perry Como, Fred Waring and Ray Eberle; music for the \"Alaskan Stampede,\" a Leo Seltzer produced \"musical extravaganza on ice\" c. 1944, and an opera based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer. He is best known for composing Symphony No. 1, known as the Alaskan Symphony, at Gypsy Trail, Carmel, New York in 1945. The work includes text from the \"Spell of the Yukon\" by Robert W. Service sung by a baritone soloist in the third movement, as well as other thematic inspirations drawn from his study of the climate, topography and history of the then-territory. The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time. Wilson Sawyer conducted the piece and Gov. Ernest Gruening of Alaska was guest speaker on the program. At Gruening's request, the original score was placed in the Alaskan Museum of Natural History [Alaska Historical Library and Museum] in Juneau, Alaska. In 1960, Sawyer's wife Maxine was diagnosed with spinal cancer and they moved to Pawling, New York where he operated a chicken farm and laundromat. He continued to compose. The Alaskan Symphony was performed by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in 1975 with Sawyer again conducting even though he had recently suffered a stroke. Sawyer revised the Symphony in 1977, making substantial cuts to the fourth movement among other edits. The revised Alaskan Symphony was premiered by the Juneau Symphony on June 14, 2008, conducted by music director Kyle Wiley Pickett.",

The song has been performed by musicians such as Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, and was redone by Emcee Lynx and The Nightwatchman. It is still commonly sung at union meetings and rallies in the United States, Australia and Canada, and has also been sung at conferences of the Australian Labor Party and the Canadian New Democratic Party.

On October 20, 1974, a night club called the Tomorrow Club opened in the old theater. Under the Tomorrow Club name, the venue hosted such bands as AC/DC, KISS, Rush, Ted Nugent, The Ramones and The Runaways. Most notably the club played host to The Ramones' first gig outside of the New York City metro area on July 20, 1976. This was also the gig where Joey Ramone was introduced to future members of the Dead Boys who later moved to New York City to set up shop as the house band at CBGB. The Tomorrow Club closed on December 22, 1978 and the venue opened as the Youngstown branch of the Agora concert hall chain on December 31, 1978.The Youngstown Agora continued to book popular rock acts until it closed on July 23, 1982. It reopened under the State Theater and Civic Center name in May 1983, but it closed abruptly again in July 1983. The theater booked heavy metal and hard rock acts under the Star Theatre name from 1984 until early '86 before being bought by a group interested in turning the theater into a showcase for R&B, blues, jazz, hip-hop and soul groups in late 1986.

It was initially housed at Merrill Hall when it opened in 1913 before moving into Kent Hall in 1916. In 1926 it relocated to the William A. Cluff Teacher Training Building, now known as Franklin Hall. The school was moved to a new building at the corner of Morris Road and East Summit Street in 1956. This building is today known as the Michael Schwartz Center and houses several student services and administrative offices. The university closed the school in phases, starting with the high school portion (grades 10\u201312) in 1972.

Patrick Henry is one of four high schools in Hanover County, and the only High school in the western half of the county. In 1959, after years of deliberation, Patrick Henry High School began with the consolidation of Beaverdam, Henry Clay, Montpelier, and Rockville high schools. The western Hanover County high school enrolled students in grades eight through twelve. The name of the school, as well as the name of its literary publications, The Voice, The Spark, and The Orator, reference the history of Patrick Henry, Hanover County's most illustrious citizen. Even the school colors of red, white, and blue are a patriotic symbol of history. In 1969, Patrick Henry High and John M. Gandy High School merged to form one Integrated student body. Also in 1969, a new junior high school was built, and Patrick Henry opened that school year as a senior high school serving students in grades ten through twelve. When the junior high school was changed to a middle school in 1988, Patrick Henry became a high school enrolling students in grades nine through twelve. The school campus of West Patrick Henry Road, which consists of a complex of buildings, began as a campus style school. Additions of an auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria, new gymnasium, and renovations to the media center and administrative offices resulted in an all-enclosed facility in 1992. As the population and the needs of the school have changed, so have the dimensions of the school. A new addition/renovation was added to the facility in the fall of 2001 providing state-of-the-art career and technical education opportunities. This addition consisted of a broadcasting studio, a bio-technology lab, a communication technology center, a computer-assisted drafting lab, and three classrooms. Patrick Henry celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2009. Patrick Henry High has an International Baccalaureate program, as well as a NJROTC program. Patrick Henry High is especially known for its NJROTC program that is consistently ranked among the top in the state of Virginia. During the 2010-2011 school year, a program called Rachel's Challenge was introduced. Patrick Henry High is also noted for its theatre program, being the best in the county, and taken most seriously.",

He determined that the changes in blood oxygen levels cause its magnetic resonance imaging properties to change, allowing a map of blood, and hence, functional, activity in the brain to be created. This map reflected which neurons of the brain responded with electrochemical signals to mental processes. He was the first scientist who demonstrated that the functional brain imaging is depended on the oxygenation status of the blood, the BOLD effect. The technique was therefore called Blood oxygenation level-dependent or BOLD contrast.

Mishima is considered one of the most important Japanese authors of the 20th century. He was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968 but the award went to his countryman Yasunari Kawabata. His works include the novels \"Confessions of a Mask\" and \"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\", and the autobiographical essay \"Sun and Steel\". His avant-garde work displayed a blending of modern and traditional aesthetics that broke cultural boundaries, with a focus on sexuality, death, and political change. Mishima was active as a nationalist and founded his own right-wing militia, the Tatenokai. In 1970, he and three other members of his militia staged an attempted \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" when they seized control of a Japanese military base and took the commander hostage, then tried and failed to inspire a coup to restore the Emperor's pre-war powers. Mishima then committed ritual suicide by \"seppuku\". The coup attempt became known as the \"Mishima Incident\".",

The name of the band derives from the song \"Tamashi Kogashite\" of the rock band ARB. The reason they put the \"Group\" in the band name is \"Nobody didn't say 'Group' by myself.\" In 2008 they released a long-awaited new album entitled \"Patsun Patsun\". It was their longest album to date, at 27 tracks, and featured them covering a new variety of musical genres such as reggae and hip-hop. 2010 marks the group's 15th anniversary, and several releases and events are scheduled in honor of it, including a new album entitled 1!2!3!4!.",

That same year she became a member of the \"Cantors Assembly of America\". The 1984 Olympics were held in Los Angeles, and Rich was chosen as their official cantor; she also sang at the \"1984 World Chassidic Festival\" in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv. An album entitled \"World Chassidic Festival\" was later released, containing among other songs her recording of \"Barcheynu Avinu.\" In January 2008, Cantor Linda received a Commendation from the \"City of Los Angeles\" for her \"extraordinary talent and accomplishments\". Rich is a fifth-generation cantor from an Orthodox Jewish family. Her father was well-known Cantor Israel Reich (Z'L) of New York and Los Angeles, and both of her brothers, Barry and Brian, are cantors as well in the Bay Area. Together, the 4 cantors concertized throughout the country during the 80's and 90's and eventually recorded their own album entitled \"The Reich Family, Cantors Four\". Linda's daughter, Rachel Reich Freed, plans on one day becoming the sixth generation of cantors in the \"Reich Family\", as they are known. After the passing of her grandfather in March 1999, Rachel was included in the family concerts as the fourth cantor. The concerts were renamed \"The Reich Family, Cantors Three plus One\". Linda is married to Philip Freed of London, England. She majored in Theatre Arts and Music at San Francisco State University, and received scholarships to study acting at the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT), musical theatre at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and is also an accomplished classical pianist. In addition to her membership in the Cantors Assembly of America (CA), Linda is also a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and appeared in minor television roles prior to becoming a full-time cantor.",

        "text": "A combination company was a theatrical touring company which performed only one play. Unlike repertory companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions. Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated. Combination companies contributed to the early success of Broadway theatre, as most combination companies began their tours in New York City. Combination companies were fueled by stars. The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company. The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform. Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there. \u201cThe engagements of the first important stars\u2026 were rare and special events\u201d(Poggi 4). Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars. The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star. The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5). After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual. Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them. They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201). This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies.",

There are no rail freight bridges or tunnels that cross the Hudson River south of Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard. As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel 140 mi north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way. Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common. However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the \"Water Level Route\" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and it is still used by the New York Central's successor, CSX, for traffic to both sides of the Hudson River.",

The \"curse\" supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game. The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media. Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136). Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all. Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.",

The site was first exploited by Ed Haggerty, a prospector from Whitehaven, England, in 1897 when he established the Rudefeha Mine on a rich deposit of copper ore. Haggerty was backed by George Ferris and other investors, of whom all but Ferris dropped out. The partners sold an interest to Willis George Emerson, who raised investment funding for improvements to the mine. These facilities included a 16 mi aerial tramway from Grand Encampment over the Continental Divide to the in Encampment. The mine's assets were eventually acquired by the North American Copper Company for $1 million. By 1904 the mine had produced $1.4 million in copper ore, and was sold to the Penn-Wyoming Copper Company. However, even with copper prices peaking in 1907, the company had difficulty making a profit from the remote mine site. The company was over-capitalized and under-insured and was suffered devastating fires at the mine site in March 1906 and May 1907 which halted production. Business disputes and a fall in copper prices prevented re-opening of the mine even after it was rebuilt. Machinery was salvaged after a foreclosure in 1913. A total of $2 million in copper ore was extracted from the mine during its life.",

The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada. Webb first recorded the song on his album \"El Mirage\", released in May 1977. The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album \"Highwayman\". In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. Their first album, \"Highwayman\", became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs \"Billboard\" chart in a twenty-week run. Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986. The song has since been recorded by other artists.

In 1923 he went to Britain and made two films \"Hutch Stirs 'em Up\" and \"Hurricane Hutch in Many Adventures\" for the Ideal Film Company. He made one last serial in 1926, \"Lightning Hutch\", for Arrow Film Company. It was meant to be a comeback vehicle, but the production company went into bankruptcy just as it was released.",

He worked to influence the internal affairs of numerous Latin American nations, typically focusing on economic and political influence rather than direct military intervention. After Lyndon B.

In March 1964, Mann outlined a policy of supporting regime change and promoting the economic interests of U.S. businesses. This policy, which moved away from the political centrism of Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, has been called the Mann Doctrine.

In 1808 it was held jointly between Southwell and Robert Cannings Esq, who were also entitled to sit at the Court Baron, appoint the steward, and pass sentence on legal cases such as encroachment, amercements, obstruction and presentment; and the appointment of a petty constable to the parish. Lord Southwell appointed Thomas Wakerman of Graig, another Roman Catholic, in 1810 to be his manor steward. Wakerman was also a solicitor and eminent local historian.

Filming in Taiwan began on August 19, 2016 in Kaohsiung and ended on January 17, 2017 in Taipei. The crew then head for Jordan to film the war scenes as Jordan is relatively safer than Syria. The filming was completed on February 14, 2017. \"Wake Up 2\" has a total of thirteen episodes and is the first Taiwanese television series to film in a Middle Eastern country, where filming took place in refugee camps in the Northern Borders Region of the Jordan River and Syria, to depict the selflessness and heroism of humanitarian rescue. This series had 5 times the production budget compared to the prequel, up to NT$60 million. The two main storylines are the humanitarian rescue in Middle East, the subway bombing incident in Kaoshiung (filmed in Taoyuan HSR station), and continuation of the continuation of Human Meatball Controversy in series one.

The song attracted attention with controversial lyrics that seemed to mock alternative rock superstars the Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots; Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan expressed his displeasure in magazine interviews, while songwriter Stephen Malkmus maintained that his words had been misinterpreted and no insult was intended. Regardless, Pavement, which was due to tour for Lollapalooza in 1994, got kicked out when the Smashing Pumpkins, the headlining act, threatened to cancel their Lollapalooza dates if Pavement played. Pavement would eventually play Lollapalooza the next year. An early 1993 demo of the song did not feature this verse; guitarist Spiral Stairs recalled in 2004 that when Malkmus first revealed these new lyrics to his bandmates at the New York City recording sessions for \"CRCR\", \"we almost lost our lunch from laughing so much.\" The single was not commercially released in the USA; it was issued by the band's UK label at the time, Big Cat.

Bio-diplomacy is involved in enhancing international cooperation in environmental issues and actively supports efforts to maintain biological and cultural diversity.

It can be thus understood as the differentiation of workers based on characteristics such as color, race, origin, gender etc. that can be classified as factors that do not have a role in determining his or her productivity. There are multiple dimensions that need to be considered when discussing such discrimination. The most obvious is that the group discriminated against is paid less for identical jobs. This is known as wage discrimination and is the most prevalent form of discrimination. The attempt to combat such a form of discrimination can be seen in increasing equal pay legislation in different countries. Examples of this are the Equal Pay Act (1970), Sex Discrimination Act (1975), and Employment Protection Act (1975), but the effectiveness of such legislation is subject to much debate. Secondly, that the level of unemployment for the disadvantaged group in general is higher than that of other groups that do not face such discrimination. Thirdly, there is discrimination based on the kind of jobs that they have access to, the discriminated group given preference for repetitive and menial tasks.This is known as employment discrimination, where an individual is excluded from a job that is worked on by a person with equal productivity. When this happens, the disadvantaged group is employed for a job he or she is over-qualified for, simply because the group does not have access to better paying jobs in par to their counterparts and are denied opportunities of recruitment and promotion. A general misconception prevails that discrimination is only practiced by the employer. This is not true. In addition to employer discrimination, customer discrimination can also exist in the market. Customers may prefer to transact with only a certain kind of people.",

Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change. Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern Civil Rights Movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active.

It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to other fabrics, becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s. Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States. Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century. The establishment of homes, businesses and recreation areas in the mill village was a significant factor in the development of the West Durham, especially the Ninth Street business district and the Old West Durham Neighborhood.

Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends. Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means which it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.

Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years. It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development. The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product. These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design. The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF). When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted. As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also. The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF. The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualifications/default.asp?area=130. This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible. However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded. On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.",

The original store, coffee shop, post office building still stands today and has been renovated into a home. The town for many years held many stores, a large hotel, coffee shops, car dealership, school and a busy rail depot that served the Northern communities along Highway 621. A restaurant called The Green Onion was the local favourite, it was open 7 days a week and held indoor livery stables below for the travels from Morson who came to town to meet the trains, liquor was served here as well. Today there is only one business left, the Canada Postal outlet. Lowes Lumber a local business for over 80 years went into bankruptcy and closed its doors in 2014. Only about 20 homes remain, even though an official town plan was made to accommodate many more. The rail siding was removed in 1993, the last of the CN hotel burned away in the late 1980s and the grocery store was demolished when the natural gas line was installed to serve the larger communities along Highway 11.",

People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride. She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller). Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear. Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there.

A congregation of General Baptists began to meet in the 17th century in the village, which was a local centre for Protestant Nonconformist worship, and by the time the present simple Vernacular-style chapel was constructed in 1740 a large proportion of the population held Baptist beliefs. Along with other General Baptist chapels in Sussex, the congregation moved towards Unitarian views in the mid-18th century; this caused a schism which resulted in a new chapel being formed at nearby Wivelsfield. The character of the Ditchling chapel was wholly Unitarian by 1800, and it has continued under various names since then. People associated with the chapel include William Hale White (the author \"Mark Rutherford\"), Henry Acton, Adrian Boult\u2014who was married there\u2014and G. K. Chesterton. The chapel is set back from Ditchling's main street and has an adjoining house (built in 1672) and graveyard, all of which contribute to the character of the conservation area which covers the centre of Ditchling village.

Educated at the school of the Paris Opera Ballet, he joined the company in 1801 after an initial engagement with Jean Dauberval in Bordeaux. The Paris Opera's \"ma\u00eetre de ballet\" Pierre Gardel presented an obstacle which led Aumer to choose the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin as the venue for which to create his early ballets. Faced with the implacable competition from Gardel, Aumer left France for engagements in Kassel (1808\u20131814) and Vienna (1814\u20131820). Brief periods in Paris (1821\u20131822) and London (1824\u20131825) were followed by his return to the Paris Opera Ballet (1820\u20131831), where, enriched by the experience of working abroad, he engaged in a profound renovation of the French repertory, capped by his \"chef-d'\u0153uvre\", \"Manon Lescaut\" (1830).",

The building occupies the southeast corner of the intersection of Oakes Avenue and Wall Street in the city's central business district. It was constructed in 1904 with a gift of US$25,000 from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for the purpose of constructing a public library. The architectural firm of Heide and deNeuf designed the building using the Pomona, California Public Library and Boston Public Library as its models. The library opened on July 1, 1905, with a newly purchased stock of 4,000 volumes on its shelves. It operated until 1935, when it was superseded by the new Everett Public Library at 2702 Hoyt Avenue which opened in October 1934. The building became the Cassidy Funeral Home from 1935 to 1980. Snohomish County took ownership in 1980, installing the offices of the County Executive. Subsequently, the building was occupied by the Snohomish County Museum of History, a three-year arrangement that ended in 2011 when lease negotiations with the county failed. Although it is part of the Snohomish County Government Complex, as of 2015 the Carnegie Building stood vacant.",

She competed in the heptathlon at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, finishing in 18th place behind teammate Jackie Joyner Kersee's still current world record. As the event was in transition to become an official event, she set the world record in the women's triple jump twice in the mid-1980s. Because this was before the event was declared official, neither of those records were officially ratified. Brown went to the University of Southern California where she won the 1986 NCAA Indoor Championship in the Triple Jump and later winning 1988 NCAA Championship in the Heptathlon. She is still the school record holder in the Triple Jump and Heptathlon, as well as being ranked second in Long Jump and High Jump. She's even ranked 5th in the Javelin throw.",
