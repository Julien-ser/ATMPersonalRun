        "text": "Mario Bava (31 July 1914 \u2013 27 April 1980) was an Italian cinematographer, director, special effects artist and screenwriter, frequently referred to as the \"Master of Italian Horror\" and the \"Master of the Macabre\".His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature.Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as \"Hercules\" (1958) and its sequel \"Hercules Unchained\" (1959)(each were lampooned on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\").During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including \"I Vampiri\" (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), \"The Day the Sky Exploded\" (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), \"Caltiki \u2013 The Immortal Monster\" (1959) and \"The Giant of Marathon\" (1959).Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock.Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres: \"Black Sunday\" (1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle; \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963) is considered to be the first giallo film; \"Kill, Baby, Kill\" (1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror; \"Roy Colt & Winchester Jack\" (1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns; \"Four Times That Night\" (1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and \"A Bay of Blood\" (1971) was a precursor to slasher films.His other notable films include \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (1961), \"Erik the Conqueror\" (1961), \"Black Sabbath\" (1963), \"The Whip and the Body\" (1963), \"Blood and Black Lace\" (1964), \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965), \"Knives of the Avenger\" (1966),  (1968), \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\" (1970), \"Five Dolls for an August Moon\" (1970), \"Baron Blood\" (1972), \"Lisa and the Devil\" (1974), \"Rabid Dogs\" (1974) and \"Shock\" (1977).Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood.Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino.His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right.",

J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades.Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States.With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll.His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\".Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work.He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided.In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours.In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\".Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music.He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel.He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.",

DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry.In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the 10 greatest female stars of classic American cinema.Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age.The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from her teens onward; her self-image was influenced and constantly criticized by film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive.Those same executives manipulated her onscreen physical appearance.Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as financial instability; she often owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes.Her lifelong addiction to drugs, including alcohol, ultimately led to her death in London from an accidental barbiturate overdose at age 47.",

Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record \"Astral Weeks\" (1968).Though this album gradually garnered high praise, it was initially a poor seller.Van Morrison has a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime.His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired; while many of his recordings, such as the studio albums \"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\", and the live album \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\", are acclaimed.\"Moondance\" (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances.He continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains.Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed GirlJackie Wilson Said (I'm in HeavenWhen You Smile)Domino\" and \"Wild Night\".An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album \"Astral Weeks\" and the lesser known \"Veedon Fleece\" and \"Common One\".The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic soul\".He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland.He is known by the nicknameVan the Man to his fans.",

        "text": "The Da Vinci Code is a 2006 American mystery thriller film, directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, based on Dan Brown's 2003 best- selling novel of the same name.The first in the\" Robert Langdon\" film series, the film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany.In the movie, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology from Harvard University, is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauni\u00e8re.In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation.A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo da Vinci's wall painting,\" The Last Supper\".Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within Opus Dei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity.The film, like the book, was considered controversial.It was met with especially harsh criticism by the Catholic Church for the accusation that it is behind a two- thousand- year- old cover- up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations Priory of Sion and Opus Dei.Many members urged the laity to boycott the film.In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and\" all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\"The film grossed$ 224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of$ 758 million worldwide, becoming the second- highest- grossing film of 2006.The film received generally negative reviews from critics.It was followed by two sequels,\" Angels& Demons\"( 2009) and\" Inferno\"( 2016).",

Corral\", and \"Blazing Saddles\", although his recordings were not charted as a country & western.Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues.He did not sing the soundtrack song for \"High Noon\", which was sung by Tex Ritter, but his own version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit, nor did he sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with\u2014\"Championthe Wonder Horse\" (sung by Mike Stewart)\u2014but released his own, subsequently more popular, version.Laine's enduring popularity was illustrated in June 2011, when a TV-advertised compilation called \"Hits\" reached No. 16 on the British chart.The accomplishment was achieved nearly 60 years after his debut on the UK chart, 64 years after his first major U.S. hit and four years after his death.",

S. Johar and his elder brother, B.R. Chopra.He made directorial debut with \"Dhool Ka Phool\" in 1959, a melodrama about illegitimacy, and followed it with the social drama \"Dharmputra\" (1961).Chopra rose to prominence after directing the commercially and critically successful drama, \"Waqt\" (1965), which pioneered the concept of ensemble casts in Bollywood.In 1971, he founded his own production company, Yash Raj Films, whose first production was \"Daag\" (1973), a successful melodrama about a polygamous man.His success continued in the seventies, with some of Indian cinema's most successful and iconic films, including the action thriller \"Deewaar\" (1975), which established Amitabh Bachchan as the leading actor in Bollywood; the romantic drama \"Kabhie Kabhie\" (1976) and \"Trishul\" (1978).This was followed by a period of professional setback from the late 1970s to 1989.Chopra collaborated with Sridevi in two of what has been considered to be his finest films; the romantic musical \"Chandni\" (1989), which became instrumental in ending the era of violent films in Bollywood and returning to musicals, and the romantic drama \"Lamhe\" (1991), considered by critics and Chopra himself to be his best work, but underperformed at the domestic box office although brought profits overseas.After helming the critically panned \"Parampara\" (1993), Chopra directed the commercially successful psychological thriller \"Darr\" (1993), the first of his films to star Shah Rukh Khan.Chopra directed three more romantic films, all starring Khan; \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" (1997), \"Veer-Zaara\" (2004) and \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" (2012), before announcing his retirement from direction in 2012.He died of dengue fever during \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\"s production in 2012.",

Kennedy Jr journey down the Colorado River on a two-week expedition to highlight water conservation issues.Traveling by rafts, kayaks and wooden dories, they are accompanied by their daughters and guided by Shana Watahomigie, a Native American National Park ranger.The film explores America's drought and freshwater shortages, the impact on the river of damming, and human water supply needs, such as that of the city of Las Vegas.Shot in four weeks almost entirely on the Colorado River, the challenging production, which features the first 3D IMAX images of the Grand Canyon, took the 350-pound 3D IMAX camera through its paces and involved the cooperation of three Indian nations, the National Park Service, film sponsor Teva\u2019s team of kayakers and more than a dozen experienced river guides.The production represents the largest filmmaking expedition in the canyon's recent history and the last major film production of its magnitude to be shot in the canyon due to new protective restrictions on the number of crew members and equipment allowed.The film is directed by IMAX director and cinematographer Greg MacGillivray, who previously explored similar conservation themes in his Academy Award-nominated films \"The Living Sea\" and \"Dolphins\", also filmed for IMAX Theaters.The film won Best Cinematography of the Year and a Special Achievement in Filmmaking Award for the opening 3D title sequence from the Giant Screen Cinema Association.It also won a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing by the Motion Picture Sound Editors USA and was nominated for a VES Award for Outstanding Visual Effects by the Visual Effects Society.",

Pike and E. Madison Streets, beyond which is Capitol Hill, and on the south by S. Main St., beyond which is the International District.The City of Seattle provides conflicting information about its eastern limit, beyond which are Cherry Hill and the Central District.Some describe it as being bounded by Broadway and Boren Avenues, while others describe it as being bounded by 12th Avenue.First Hill rose to popularity in the 1890s as a location close enough to downtown for convenience, but far enough out to offer a sense of retreat for the wealthier residents of Seattle.Among the elite to live on First Hill at that time were Indian fighter turned wealthy businessman Granville O. Haller, local judge Cornelius H. Hanford, successful meatpacker Charles Frye (whose private art collection is now open to the public at First Hill's Frye Art Museum), contractor Morgan Carkeek (for whom Carkeek Park is named), William Boeing, founder of the Boeing Company and Judge Hiram Bond.Noted photographer Imogen Cunningham and her husband Roi Partridge lived on First Hill in a boarding house in the 1910s until the residents of the house were evicted and the property converted into a hospital.More recently, local philanthropist and businesswoman Patsy Bullitt Collins resided in a First Hill condominium.The first official King County Courthouse was built on First Hill in 1889\u20131890; the steep climb to the courthouse from downtown legal offices caused such frequent and vociferous complaints that Seattle lawyers nicknamed the area \"Profanity Hill\".The courthouse, constructed on the corner of 7th Avenue and Alder Street, was quickly outgrown, which, along with the loud dissatisfaction of local attorneys, led the county to move the courthouse off First Hill in 1916.The hill is also known as \"Pill Hill\" because, in addition to being the current home of three major health care facilities (Harborview Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, and Virginia Mason Medical Center (four if Swedish Medical Center/Cherry Hill, located on 16th Avenue, is included in the neighborhood)), as well as the Puget Sound Blood Center, it was also once the location of the Maynard, Seattle General, and Doctors Hospitals (all of which merged into Swedish) as well as Cabrini Hospital.First Hill has been home to Seattle University, a private Jesuit university, since 1891.Also located on the hill are Northwest School and Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences\u2014two highly regarded private schools\u2014and the Catholic O'Dea High School, Frye Art Museum, as well as several churches that have become city landmarks: Trinity Parish Church, St. James Cathedral, and Seattle First Baptist Church.First Hill's major thoroughfares, assuming its greatest possible extent (see above), include Madison, James, Cherry, and Jefferson Streets and Yesler Way (east- and west-bound) and 9th, Boren, and Broadway (north- and south-bound).A Link Light Rail station was originally planned for First Hill, but was cancelled due to geotechnical risks prior to the construction of University Link.Instead, the First Hill Streetcar was built on Broadway and Jackson Street to connect First Hill with the International District / Chinatown and Capitol Hill stations after it opened in 2016.",

Cain.He was thirty- three years old when his first novel,\" Kiss the Blood Off My Hands\", was published in 1940 by Jarrolds Publishing.\" Kiss the Blood Off My Hands\" became a best- seller and by 1945, it had sold over 232,000 copies in England alone( all during war- time).In 1945, American publishers Farrar& Rinehart, were the first to publish one of Butler's novels outside of England.Their first release of Butler's work was his 1943 novel,\" Their Rainbow Had Black Edges\", issued under the title\" Dark Rainbow\".Farrar& Rinehart went on to publish four more of his novels for the American market, between 1946 and 1951.Following the publication of his first four novels, Eagle- Lion Films bought the film rights to\" Kiss the Blood Off My Hands\" in 1946, hoping to turn it into a Robert Donat film.After the option expired, the novel's film rights were sold to actor- turned- producer Burt Lancaster and his business partner Harold Hecht in mid-1947.The film was the first project for Lancaster's new production company, Norma Productions, and hit the screens in October 1948.The film starred Joan Fontaine, Burt Lancaster and Robert Newton and was released in some markets under the names\" The Unafraid\" or\" Blood on My Hands\", due to censor issues.Meanwhile, producer/ director Mario Zampi approached Butler in 1947 to collaborate on a film noir thriller,\" The Fatal Night\".Butler adapted Michael Arlen's famous short story,\" The Gentleman From America\" into a screenplay for the film which was released in April 1948.Butler and Zampi collaborated again a year later for the Zampi- produced\" Third Time Lucky\", Butler's screen adaptation of his own novel\" They Cracked Her Glass Slipper\".The film was released in January 1949 and was directed by Gordon Parry.A third Butler novel was turned into a film,\" Mad with Much Heart\", released as\" On Dangerous Ground\".It starred Ida Lupino( who was also an uncredited director) and Robert Ryan and was directed by Nicholas Ray.This last film adaption was released in 1951, the same year that Butler's sixth novel,\" Blow Hot, Blow Cold\", was published.He withdrew from the writing industry for nearly twenty years before returning with his last novel,\" There Is a Death, Elizabeth\", published in 1972.He died sixteen years later.",

        "text": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years.Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement.His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" the following year.The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall.\"For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs.He went on to release the politically charged \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the more lyrically abstract and introspective \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\" in 1964.In 1965 and 1966, Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: \"Bringing It All Back Home\" (1965), \"Highway 61 Revisited\" (1965) and \"Blonde on Blonde\" (1966).The six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) has been described as challenging and transforming the \"artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\"In July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident.During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour.These recordings were released as the collaborative album \"The Basement Tapes\" in 1975.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in \"John Wesley Harding\" (1967), \"Nashville Skyline\" (1969), and \"New Morning\" (1970).In 1975, he released \"Blood on the Tracks\", which many saw as a return to form.In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s.The major works of his later career include \"Time Out of Mind\" (1997), \"Love and Theft\" (2001), \"Modern Times\" (2006) and \"Tempest\" (2012).His most recent recordings have comprised versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra.Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.He has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.He has also received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award.Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\"In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"",

        "text": "Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 \u2013 December 4, 1993) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician, composer, and bandleader.His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and \"musique concr\u00e8te\" works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers.He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize.While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music.He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar.His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, \"Freak Out!\", combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages.He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed \"Project/Object\", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the \"godfather\" of comedy rock.He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship.Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs, but supported their decriminalization and regulation.During Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth.He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an independent artist for most of his career.He remains a major influence on musicians and composers.His honors include his 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.In 2000, he was ranked number 36 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him at number 71 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".",

Warwick, Henry's heir Edward of Westminster and other senior Lancastrians were killed, while Henry died in the Tower of London a few days later.England remained relatively peaceful until Edward's death in 1483.His two minor sons, Edward and Richard were subsequently declared illegitimate by his younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III.",

Grant in the winter of 1862 during the battles of forts Henry and Donelson.Before the Battle of Shiloh, Sherman commanded a division.Failing to make proper preparations for a Confederate offensive, his men were surprised and overrun.He later rallied his division and helped drive the Confederates back.Sherman later served in the Siege of Corinth and commanded the XV Corps during the Vicksburg Campaign, which led to the fall of the critical Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River.After Grant was promoted to command of all Western armies, Sherman took over the Army of the Tennessee and led it during the Chattanooga Campaign, which culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee.In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the western theater of the war.He proceeded to lead his troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of Abraham Lincoln.Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting by destroying large amounts of supplies and demoralizing the Southern people.The tactics that he used during this march, though effective, remain a subject of controversy.He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865, after having been present at most major military engagements in the West.When Grant assumed the U.S. presidency in 1869, Sherman succeeded him as Commanding General of the Army, in which capacity he served from 1869 until 1883.As such, he was responsible for the U.S. Army's engagement in the Indian Wars over the next 15 years.Sherman advocated total war against hostile Indians to force them back onto their reservations.He was skeptical of the Reconstruction era policies of the federal government in the South.Sherman steadfastly refused to be drawn into politics and in 1875 published his \"Memoirs\", one of the best-known first-hand accounts of the Civil War.British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart declared that Sherman was \"the first modern general.\"",

Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood.A string of successful films followed, including \"Rebecca\" (1940), \"Foreign Correspondent\" (1940), \"Suspicion\" (1941), \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943), and \"Notorious\" (1946).\"Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for \"Lifeboat\" (1944) and \"Spellbound\" (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.The \"Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear.The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot.A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951) and \"Dial M For Murder\" (1954).By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"Vertigo\" (1958), \"North by Northwest\" (1959), and \"Psycho\" (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.In 2012, \"Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943).He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.",

Subba Rao's three novels\" NagarahavuOndu Gandu Eradu Hennu\" and\" Sarpa Mathsara\", and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi, K. S. Ashwath and Shubha in lead roles.The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni.This is the first Kannada movie to complete 100 days in three centres.This film was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and\" Kode Nagu\" in Telugu.The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan and Ambarish who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema.This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead.Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause.The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya( K. S. Ashwath).Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari( Vishnuvardhan) as his son.He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger.He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour.Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness.He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride.Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything.His love interests are Alamelu( Aarathi) and Margaret( Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life.The conversations between the Guru( Chamayya) and Shishya( Ramachari) is the highlight of movie all through.Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong.Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two.It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom \u2014 a cobra.The movie was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and in Telugu as\" Kode Nagu\".The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018.This movie was digitalized by Balaji who is the brother of V.Ravichandran and son of Veeraswammy who was the producer.Re-release was also a big hit and broke so- many records.The re-release got a huge appreciation from all and created a new record of collection.",

        "text": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 \u2013 April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker.A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time.His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop.Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave.Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, \"Funk Machine\", at the age of seven.He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album \"For You\" in 1978.Followed with his next four albums \u2014 \"Prince\" (1979), \"Dirty Mind\" (1980), \"Controversy\" (1981), and \"1999\" (1982)\u2014Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music.In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released \"Purple Rain\", the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name.It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the \"Billboard\" 200.The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award.Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album \"Sign o' the Times\" (1987).He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991.In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the \"Love Symbol\", and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label.He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998.In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again.He subsequently released 16 albums, including \"Musicology\" (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s.His final album, \"Hit nRun Phase Two\", was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015.In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award.He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the \"Billboard\" Icon Award.He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016.\"Rolling Stone\" ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.",

Dwipayana, and starring Amoroso Katamsi, Umar Kayam, and Syubah Asa.Produced over a period of two years with a budget of Rp. 800 million, the film was sponsored by Suharto's New Order government.It was based on an official history of the 30 September Movement( or G30S) coup in 1965 written by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia( or PKI).The film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it.In a time of economic turmoil, six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and Air Force, purportedly to pre-empt a coup against President Sukarno.General Suharto destroys the coup and, afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of communism.The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning\" every move to the last detail\", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying\" the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human\".The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965,\" Pengkhianatan G30S/ PKI\" was a commercial and critical success.It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers \u2013 although in many cases audiences were required to see the film.The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students.Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common.Although the film's artistic aspects remain well- received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.",

P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer.His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later.Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\".After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999.Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure.During his career, Jones had more than 150 hits, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists.Robert Christgau has called him \"honky-tonk's greatest honky\".",

W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts, however Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were separate.Sturges famously sold the story for \"The Great McGinty\" to Paramount Pictures for $1, in return for being allowed to direct the film.",
